Research question: Based on the Music of the Waters, what subjects appear and to what frequency in sailing songs?

First meeting 2/18. All members cloned the repo onto their own laptops. The general plan for the project was discussed, and a source file was added to the repo.

We have started cleanup of the raw text files and a markup of each of the songs and their most prominent subjects.

Basic structures of HTML files have been added to the repo. 

Two versions of the Claude AI markup of the texts were uploaded to the source file. 

A preliminary schema was made and uploaded to the XML file in the repo.
