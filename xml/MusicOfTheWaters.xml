AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 

IT is always a pleasant duty to acknowledge kindness 
and courtesy, but not always an easy one in my case it 
would be almost impossible to do so by any other means 
than that afforded me here for the world is wide, in spite 
of the daily assertions to the contrary ; and the world of 
waters is wider. There is scarcely a port, and never one of 
any consequence, that I have not to thank for some part of 
my collection ; and if the Consuls in those ports will accept 
them, I beg to tender my most cordial thanks to them for 
all the kindness and cordiality my applications have met 
with. My gratitude is also due to the Foreign Consuls in 
Great Britain, more especially to those in Newcastle-upon- 
Tyne ; to the many authors and editors of periodicals, 
from whose books and articles I have quoted ; to the 
numerous friends I know and do not know, who have done 
so much towards helping me in my work ; to the editor of 
The Shipping World (Major E. R. Jones, United States' 
Consul, Cardiff), who originated the idea of a collection of 
the sailors' songs of all nations, by commissioning me to 
write for his paper a series of articles containing specimens

of each country's " chanties ;" and last, but not least, to the 
sailors themselves, without whose unwearying patience in 
singing for me their favourite " chanties," and in supplying 
me with all necessary information as to their use, &c., I 
should not have had the honour of inscribing to His Royal 
Highness Prince George of Wales, and to all who are 
interested in the sea and its toilers, " The Music of the 
Waters."

INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 

FRESH as the breezes of that ocean to which they owe 
their inspiration, the " chanties " and songs here collected 
come to us as a most interesting and unique contribution 
to our literature of the sea. For this volume contains no 
mere study-compilation of more or less authentic sea- 
ditties, mingled with the nautical effusions of landsmen. 
It is original in its conception and execution. With one 
or two trifling exceptions, it is a collection of what may be 
styled " the genuine article " not the creation of landsmen 
written for or about sailors, but the actual " working songs " 
of the sea that are in use at the present time. 

Still further, this book contains not merely the ditties of 
our own Jack Tars, but a selection of the sea-songs of 
nearly all maritime nations, translated and ably commented 
on, from a literary, musical, and nautical point of view,, 
together with a good deal of interesting information re- 
garding them. 

Whoever will drink of an unadulterated stream must go to 
the fountain-head. This, Miss Laura Alexandrine Smith 
has done, and that she has drunk deeply, is easy to be 
seen from the spirit and enthusiasm with which she writes. 
Possessing literary power of a high order and thorough 
musical knowledge, besides originality and perseverance, 



INTRODUCTORY NOTE. 



Miss Smith was well qualified for the performance of her 
task, and being a daughter of Mr. C. S. Smith, Russian 
Vice-Consul at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, she has had excep- 
tionally good opportunities of obtaining the assistance of 
the Consuls of many ports. 

With the courage of an original investigator, our authoress 
has ventured to " beard the lion in his den." She has per- 
sonally gone straight to the " foVsle," and interviewed the 
sailors not only of her own, but of other lands, and thus 
has gathered from the men's own lips, and from their 
manly voices, the words and melodies which are most 
popular among them. At the same time she has learned 
to understand and appreciate the force and meaning of 
that music which enables Jack to accomplish " a long pull, 
and a strong pull, and a pull all together." 

Of course, in language and sentiment, some of these 
ditties are not all that could be desired, but the work being 
a collection of curious and genuine sea-songs as they exist 
not as they should be, the task of selection and translation 
must have been one of considerable difficulty, and seems to 
have been ably and judiciously accomplished. 

Doubtless to some minds a good deal of the versification 
may appear absurd, but it must be borne in mind that, in 
lyrical poetry, a strict regard for sense is not of so much 
importance as the rhythmical flow of united words and 
melody especially in songs of the sea, where the union of 
syllables with sounds must be well suited to the " work " 
which they are meant to enliven and facilitate. Besides, 
is not the odd jumble of ideas and phrases, pathetic and 
ludicrous, presented in some of the chanties, in keeping 
with the well-known rough-and-tumble character of the 
men who sing them ? 



INTRODUCTORY NOTE. xi 

When merely read, these chanties cannot be fully or 
fairly appreciated, but when wedded to their appropriate 
" Music of the Waters," they will doubtless convey to the 
soul of the landsman somewhat of that interest and satis- 
faction which they have long afforded to the " toilers of the 
deep " all round the world. 

To those who have wandered much over our little globe 
especially to those who have done so in ships and seen 
something of the wonderful works of God in the deep, and 
become familiar with the hopes, joys, sorrows, sins, and 
sufferings of the sailor in his selected home these 
" chanties " will assuredly bring back, like a half-forgotten 
yet never-to-be-forgotten dream, many a pleasant 
memory of tramping round the capstan, and heaving at 
the windlass, and yarns told in low tones when sails were 
flapping idly, and the starry host was mirrored grandly in 
the sleeping sea. No puny invention of man steam or 
electric will ever take the romance out of the sea ! Every- 
thing here is relative. Man may modify his conditions. 
Some old things may pass away and some things may be- 
come new ; but, as the great vault of heaven and the 
mighty ocean will remain unchanged and unchangeable 
from age to age, so will the music of the waters, not less 
than the music of the land, continue to well up in human 
souls, to gladden, strengthen and revive them, until that 
time comes when all music shall flow into one grand 
harmony of praise to our God and to the Lamb.

flow of the waves, and the soothing murmur of running water, have 
led various nations, independently of each other, to the wide-spread 
conception that they obtained their favourite instrument of music 
originally from the water ? Or is this notion traceable to a common 
source, dating from a prehistoric age ; perhaps from the early period 
when the Aryan race is surmised to have diffused its lore through 
various countries ? Or did it originate in the old belief of the world 
with all its charms and delights having arisen from a chaos in which

passed away, and with the fleet Atlantic " greyhounds " 
fades the last glamour of mystery from the pages of marine 
history. But the romance of the sea can never die, and 
for all time we shall have the storms and calms that alter- 
nately rule the watery way, the wrecks and losses, the 
longings, the waitings, and the terrible tales, to remind us 
of man's inability to cope with the mysterious, trackless 
deep. 

There is one being though who is never familiar with 
the sea, and that is the being who knows it best, namely, 
the sailor. In all he says or sings of the world of water 
that is his home, Jack is never guilty of any sentiment 
that breathes of mastery over the element, or exults in the 
life of the sea ; it is too real a thing for him to adopt the 
conscious boastful, masterful tone which is attributed to 
him, and it is only sometimes in the impotence of despair 
that fierce imprecations on sea or wind will break from 
him. It is Gibbon who says, " There is but a plank be- 
tween a sailor and eternity." 

The poetry of the sea is written on shore. Sailors act 
it, but do not write it. They form part of the poetry of 
ocean ; they are the heroes that shine from its living, 
terrible pages ; they are, they must be, brave men who 
can do their duty 'midst such perils. They must be 
brave, or nature brands them cowards, for the wind and 
the wave are infallible tests of all a sailor's knots and 
splices. Neptune is an unrelenting judge, and hurries 
his prisoner, without trial or jury, into the Everlasting 
Presence. 

Three great pleasures, in the midst of all his perils and 
privations, we may rest assured Jack enjoys: smoking, 
yarning, and singing. With a pipe, whensoever and 



INTRODUCTION. 



wheresoever he can manage to hold it between his lips, a 
fairly appreciative audience round the galley fire or at the 
fo'c'sle head, and a song to enliven his labour when on the 
briny ocean, our blue-jacket is tolerably happy, and it is of 
this latter I am purposing to make a short study for that 
sailors' songs are worth studying I am convinced, and from 
various points of view too. Musically they are most valu- 
able, as showing how much they are characteristic of their 
subject, vocationally, as proving the amount of impetus or 
encouragement needed by the singer in his work, and 
poetically, by making known the feelings which animate a 
sailor's breast with regard to his home, his wife, his captain, 
and indeed all that concerns him, often as an exponent of 
Jack's intense admiration for the noble and heroic acts of 
others. With regard to smoking, there is a curious story 
told of an old salt who when in port was very fond of a 
churchwarden. On being asked if he always smoked a 
long pipe ? he replied, " No ; in harbours and in fine 
weather I smoke a long pipe ; in fresh weather I smoke a 
cutty, and when it blows a gale of wind I chew." 

Not Dibdin's, not Barry Cornwall's, not Campbell's, not 
any of the Pirates' Serenades, or " I'm Afloats," which may 
be seen in music-shop windows, illustrated by lithographic 
vignettes of impossible ships in impracticable positions, and 
may be heard sung in comfortable drawing-rooms to the 
tinkling of pianos by romantic young ladies, or in still 
waters in sight of green fields by landsmen yachting not 
any of these are the songs that come under the heading of 
" Chanties, or Working Songs of the Sea." The songs of 
the sailor are sung to the accompaniment of the thrilling 
shrouds, the booming double bass of the hollow topsails, 
and the multitudinous chorus of ocean. 

a 2 



xx INTRODUCTION. 



As the ship is originally wrought from the live oak- 
forests of Florida, and the pine mountains of Norway, the 
iron-mines of England, the hemp and flax fields of Russia, 
so the songs current upon her decks are the composite gifts 
of all sea-loving peoples. In almost all nations we find 
that each individual trade and occupation has its own 
particular songs, differing many times even in provinces of 
the same country, so, naturally, maritime countries have 
many kinds of sailors' songs, each port often being respon- 
sible for some particular chanty. Many of these seem 
lacking in meaning, but to us of the shore only. Depend 
upon it something commends them to the tar's notice. 
They must contain good mouth-filling words, with the 
vowels in the right place, and the rhythmic ictus at proper 
distance for chest and hand to keep true time ; and at any 
rate these sea-songs are redolent of the freshness of the sea- 
breeze. 

Talking of the dangers which menace our sailors 
reminds me of a story I heard a propos of this. A clergy- 
man much interested in the blue-jackets was one day talk- 
ing to one whom he wished to bring round to his way of 
thinking. 

" How long have you been at sea ? " he began. 

" Twenty years," was the reply. 

" Was your father a sailor ? " 

" Yes. He was drowned at sea." 

" And your grandfather ? " 

" He was also lost at sea/' 

" But this is an awful prospect for you, my poor man. 
Are you not afraid to go to sea ? " 

Jack screwed up his eye, and put a fresh quid into his 
mouth preparatory to answering. 



INTRODUCTION. xxi 



" Quits, parson ; where did your father die ? " 
" In bed, of course, like a good Christian." 
" And your grandfather ? " 
" He died in his bed too." 

" That's bad, parson," says Jack, " are you not afraid to 
go to bed ? " 

The foregoing may be taken as a sample of a sailor's 
feelings when interviewed on the subject of his perilous 
life. The danger is there, and he is fully alive to it, and, 
as I have said before, is never familiar when speaking of the 
sea. But in any encounter like that just referred to, in 
which the slightest shade of doubt as to Jack's daring to 
trust himself on it, is mooted : the one who hazards the 
doubt is almost certain to get the worst of it. 

I am quite aware that if I allude to the bad accommo- 
dation and scanty and coarse fare, as the portion of our 
sailors, I tread on dangerous ground. Our times are 
supposed to be changed times, and changed for the 
better too, for the blue-jackets ; I trust it may be so. 
In speaking of Jack's lot, I do so comparatively, not 
from any wish to enter into so vexed a question as our 
sailor's condition has now become. With regard to the 
improvidence that is so characteristic of seafaring men, I 
cannot help thinking that, however much it is to be con- 
doned on the score of their peculiar life, it is as much to 
be deplored for the lack of energy that fails to perceive 
and seize upon the means of remedy which are so palpably 
at hand, namely, the establishment of a compulsory sea- 
men's fund. Other trades and occupations make provi- 
sion for their members when age shall have robbed them 
of their power of labour, or illness have laid them tempo- 
rarily aside ; but for the sailors there is no such provision. 



INTRODUCTION. . 



The evil arising from the want of it is very apparent ; the 
remedy seems to lie with themselves. In the Shipping 
World of July, 1887, there appeared a paragraph stating 
that Mr. Thomas H. Ismay, head of the White Star Line, 
had suggested to the Mayor of Liverpool the foundation of a 
Seamen's Pension Fund, and promised to give it a start with 
the princely donation of 20,000. The object of the fund 
would be to provide pensions for British sailors who have 
sailed out of Liverpool, or in Liverpool-owned ships, and 
who have been unable to make adequate provision for their 
declining years. The pension would be fixed at 20 a 
year, and on no account would be given to other than a 
British sailor, and no seaman to be eligible for a pension 
who had not attained the age of fifty years, and could 
prove twenty-five years' service at sea, either as captain, 
deck officer, or seaman. The fund, Mr. Ismay suggests, 
might be invested in the name of the Mercantile Marine 
Service Association, who will have the power of selecting 
suitable candidates for the pension. No great home to be 
erected, the whole of the fund to be applied to the object 
in view. 

One can scarcely wonder at the style or sentiment 
of these Sailor Chanties, seeing that they are really, in 
many cases, the true expression of the feelings of the 
men who originate them the strangest men perhaps, 
taking them all in all, one can meet with ; though, cer- 
tainly, I think Jack is somewhat less black than he is 
painted. As Lord Brassey in his work on "British Seamen" 
says : " Sailors spend their life for the most part far re- 
moved from the best influences which can elevate human 
nature, far from their native land, far from their hearths 
and homes, on the broad and lonely sea, where the 



INTRODUCTION. xxiii 



authority of the magistrate cannot reach, where public 
opinion is unfelt, and the Sabbath bell is unheard." He is 
hardly to be judged by the same standard as a landsman, 
his life is so different. So much rougher discipline, so 
much more severe, that no wonder during their sometimes 
short holidays our tars squander their substance in the 
riotous manner that has become proverbial of them. Think 
how many months they spend in exile, enduring many 
serious hardships, beside which the trials of shore-men 
seem insignificant ; scanty rations, often of the most re- 
volting description, always of the coarsest ; hard, rough 
work in the most terrible degrees of heat and cold, 
wretched accommodation, and at all times the presence 
of imminent peril, which, although naturally the case in all 
lives, always seems to me to be more terribly near at sea. 
And we must confess a sailor's life has much to make it 
undesirable, and yet, for all that, taking them as a class, 
they are healthy, hearty fellows, and well deserving of the 
epithet of "Jolly Tars." 

Knowing what an impressionable set of men sailors as a 
rule are, we cannot wonder that anything which appeals so 
much to the emotional side of nature as music does, should 
play an important part in their daily round of work. What 
the " Ranz des Vaches " does for the Swiss herder when 
minding his flocks on the hills of his country, the " Mar- 
seillaise " for the eager Frenchman on his way to death or 
victory, the discordant sound of the bagpipes for the High- 
lander on a foreign battle-field, that does the chanty for 
the blue-jacket. It is not recreation, it is an essential part 
of the work on ship-board, it mastheads the topsail yards 
when making sail, it starts and weighs the anchor, it brings 
down the main-tack with a will, it loads and unloads the 



INTRODUCTION. 



cargo, it keeps the pumps a-going ; in fact, it does all the 
work where unison and strength are required. I have 
heard many an old salt say that a good chanty was worth 
an extra hand. At the capstan, on the topsail-halyards, 
in port and at seaj in calm or in storm, the ropes run 
smoother, the work is done quicker, when some twenty 
strong voices are singing : 

" Haul the bowline, the fore and maintop bowline, 

Haul the bowline, the bowline haul ! 
Haul the bowline, the bully, bully bowline, 
Haul the bowline, the bowline haul ! " 

In his admirably nautical novel, " Two Years before the 
Mast, or a Sailor's Life at Sea/' Mr. Dana says of the 
chanties : " The sailors' songs for capstans and falls are ot 
a peculiar kind, having a chorus at the end of each line. 
The burden is usually sung by one alone, and at the chorus 
all hands join in, and the louder the noise the better. A 
song is as necessary to sailors as the drum and fife to a 
soldier. They cannot pull in time, or pull with a will, with- 
out it. Many a time when a thing goes heavy with one 
fellow yo-ho-ing, a lively song, like * Heave to the Girls/ 
' Nancy oh ! ' ' Jack Crosstree/ &c., has put life and strength 
into every arm. We often found a great difference in the 
effect of the different songs in driving in the hides. Two or 
three songs would be tried, one after the other, with no 
effect ; not an inch could be got upon the tackles. When 
a new song struck up it seemed to hit the humour of the 
moment, and drove the tackles to blocks at once. * Heave 
round hearty/ * Captain gone Ashore/ and the like, might 
do for common pulls ; but on an emergency, when we 
wanted a heavy, raise-the-dead pull, which should start the 



INTRODUCTION. 



XXV 



beams of the ship, there was nothing like ' Time for us to 
go/ * Round the Corner/ or * Hurrah ! hurrah ! my hearty 
Bullies.' ' Cheerily, Men,' when we came to masthead the 
topsail-yard with all hands at the halyards, might have 
been heard miles away." 

Speaking again of the advantages of -music at sea, the 
same author says : " We pulled the long distances to and 
from the shore with our loaded boats without a word 
spoken, and with discontented looks, while they not only 
lightened the labour of rowing, but actually made it 
pleasant and cheerful by their music ; so true is it that 

' For the tired slave, song lifts the languid oar, 

And bids it aptly fall with chime 
That beautifies the fairest shore, 
And mitigates the harshest crime.' " 

He is alluding to the Americans in San Pedro. 

Besides the working songs, there are others for the fore- 
castle and dog-watches ; for a sailor, in his moments of 
leisure, will as soon listen to a ballad as a yarn, and an 
audience round the galley fire, or at the fo'c'sle-head, re- 
quires what the hearers of our old ballads demanded, 
plenty of stirring incident and strong true feeling simply 
expressed. Our blue-jackets ought to be familiar with the 
tales of our grand old admirals and their victories, and 
should have songs in use amongst them as a stimulus to 
energy and courage that will make Blake, Vernon, and 
Anson more than mere names to them ; those who man 
our ironclads should be full of that old spirit which de- 
feated the Armada and won Trafalgar. There is no doubt 
that the inimitable sea-songs of Dibdin have done much to 
keep up the esprit de corps of our British sailors ; they are, 



xxvi INTRODUCTION. 



in fact, an inheritance which the nation will never, it is to 
be hoped, undervalue. 

Whatever form naval warfare may hereafter assume, 
however the technicalities of the maritime profession may 
be altered, the spirit of the British seaman will be un- 
changed, he will be the same hearty, fearless, generous and 
simple being that Dibdin describes him, loving his country 
and his flag, reverencing his ship whether propelled by 
wind or steam, and adoring his Kate or Nancy. 

Not only are Dibdin's songs popular with seamen, but 
they have obtained a deep hold on the national heart. 
There are few, I think, who are not familiar with some at 
least of them, fewer who have not heard and admired the 
pathos of " Tom Bowling," perhaps the most perfect of the 
many hundred songs left us by this great master of the 
art of writing of the sea. " Poor Jack," and " Twas in 
the good Ship," are also great forecastle favourites, mixed 
up as they are with frequent quaint technical phrases and 
expressions, rendering them perfectly characteristic and 
inimitable, and expressing such thoroughly wise, brave, and 
gentle sentiments. There is another song, " I'm the Pirate 
of the Isles," a most thrilling tale of the genuine Pirate of 
the Isle of Pines, the terror of the Spanish Main, and one 
that always draws the sympathy and rouses trie interest of 
a forecastle audience. 

But the songs that Jack loves best, the songs that are 
sung with a will, whether by old or young, are the ones 
that have for theme " His Nancy," and, whether sailing 
away with the fresh memory of her last good-bye ringing 
in his ears, or homeward-bound with the eager thought of 
the welcome that will be his, she is never far from his 
thoughts. The sailors' favourite expression, rude though 



INTRODUCTION. xxvii 



the poetry of it may be, always seems to me to be 
thoroughly characteristic of their thoughts, viz. that " the 
girls have hold of the tow-rope and can't haul the slack in 
fast enough." 

There is yet another class of songs that would come 
under the heading of " Music of the Waters," though they 
are half of the shore. I mean those which the coasters 
croon in their lonely watches, those the fishermen sing 
when mending their nets ; for, though certainly this is 
properly speaking land work, still the sea is all about them, 
the very air is laden with its fresh briny smell, the sounds 
in their ears are the sounds the waves make as they break 
on the shore, their thoughts are probably far away from 
the comfortable haven where they sit, so naturally their 
song follows their thoughts and becomes of the sea. 

Rowing-songs should, I think, also be included in this 
class. They can scarcely be considered as working-songs, 
though I have no doubt the tune and swing of the music 
will have as much effect on the oarsmen as all rhythmical 
music has on work that requires to be done with strength 
and in unison. There is a certain charm about music on 
the water which that of the shore can never give, and pro- 
bably we all have some pleasant souvenirs in our minds of 
golden August mornings on the sunny Thames, or soft 
moonlit nights on some placid lake, when the perfection 
of the already perfect situation was enhanced by some 
dreamy, soothing song that seemed to waft itself over the 
water and find its echo on the distant shore. 

Doubtless more than half the romance we always associate 
with Venice is due (for those who have been there) to the 
memory of the gondolas that carried them through the 
many canals of the City of Doges, and the gondoliers who 



XXY111 



INTRODUCTION. 



at one and the same time charmed their sense of seeing and 
hearing by the picturesqueness of their costume and the soft 
snatches of song they trolled out en route, and for those 
who have not, by the description written and spoken of it, 
in which these always play so important a role. I am afraid 
I must confess for one that Venice is never so much to my 
mind the city par excellence of historical Italy, as the place 
of all others where one may most revel in the delightful 
dolce far niente of being rowed under soft Italian skies, 
by quaint and time-worn buildings, under gloomy romantic 
bridges, with a dark-eyed gondolier singing in his rich 
musical voice :

times very erratic in metre and varied in theme, and almost 
always similar, and to be traced to the general music of the 
country to which they belong. 

In one of the old volumes of Blackwood's Edinburgh 
Magazine (vol. vii., April, 1820), there is an essay on song- 
writing, and the author, who signs himself D. T., includes 
some few remarks on sea-songs. He says : " Incledon and 
Dibdin did their best to make sea-songs popular, and for a 
while they succeeded. Dibdin, however, wanted judgment, 
for from his attempts to clothe grave thoughts in seaman's 
phraseology, good taste will always revolt. In one of his 
songs the resurrection is actually alluded to thus 

* When he hears the last whistle 
He'll come upon deck.' 

To be serious, with vulgar slang, grave interest can never 
amalgamate. Divested of this, however, I do not see why 
the peculiar vicissitudes of a sailor's life might not give 
variety to the lyric music, or why the exploits of the Vikings, 
whether of good old Saxon or more modern times, are 
not as capable of tuneful commemoration as those of heroes 
upon dry land. Campbell's ' Battle of the Baltic ' I have 
read a hundred times, but have never seen the music, if 
there is any, appended to it. * Black-eyed Susan' and 
Glover's 'Admiral Hosier's Ghost' are, I think, hardly to 
be classed as sea-songs. The scenes, to be sure, are laid on 
board ship, but they embody no feelings or incident of any 
consequence which are peculiar. to a sea-life." 

D. T. can scarcely have made much study of sea-songs in 
general, if he still labours under the delusion that the 
Vikings have not formed the subject of many a stirring

lyric, not only in our country, but in those Northern ones 
more truly the theatre of the Vikings' exploits. Another 
point, which I think may be found open to discussion in 
D. T/s remarks, is the fact of Dibdin having only tempo- 
rarily succeeded in popularizing sea-songs. Are the songs 
of this great master any less popular than they were ? I 
doubt it. " Tom Bowling," perhaps his masterpiece, never 
fails to elicit hearty cheers and rapturous applause whenever 
and wherever it is heard, and there are many others almost 
equally well known and well liked. 

Different periods have, of course, great effect on all the 
arts and sciences of a country, and it would be natural 
to suppose that Music would undergo much the same 
change, but she is a vagrant Muse, and ever has been, and 
is no more to be relied upon than the moods of the wind, 
" which bloweth where it listeth." Period has made very 
little difference in the music of the sea. The " Tar " has 
sung his song and the winds moaned their sad dirges, or 
thundered their great storm-chords, the waves have mur- 
mured their lullabies to the waiting shores, and the wild 
sea-birds have screamed their hoarse choruses through all 
ages, and will continue to do so as long as man and the 
world of waters exist. 

The first vocal performance recorded in the Bible is the 
song of Miriam the prophetess and her companions after 
the crossing of the Red Sea. Surely this song of praise, 
commemorative of perhaps the most wonderful event in all 
the history of the mighty deep, is worthy a place 'midst 
the music of the waters. 

Mr. Engel, in his valuable book on " The Music of the 
most Ancient Nations," says, in speaking of this song of 
Miriam, " that it is in the form of alternate soli and chorus.

A section, or perhaps a whole period, is sung by one alone, 
then repeated by a number of singers, either in unison or 
harmony, or, the chorus, instead of repeating the melody 
of the solo, takes it up and extends it ; or else the solo 
singer is now and then interrupted by the chorus, which at 
intervals interposes a phrase."

of each other, " What manner of man is this, that even the 
wind and the sea obey Him ? " And imagination rapidly 
follows with the thankful " Gloria," and chants in chorus 
the Fishermen's " Amen."

" Sails of silk, and ropes of sendal, 
Such as gleam in ancient lore ; 
And the singing of the sailors, 
And the answer from the shore." 



RULE, BRITANNIA. 




SAILORS' talk is a dialect as distinct from ordinary English 
as is Lowland Scotch. Certainly, English words are used, 
but their signification is many times remote from the 
meaning they have in shore parlance. The meaning of 
many sea-phrases is too subtle for translation ; some fit

vocational conditions so accurately, that any divergence 
from the exact expression would puzzle a seaman exceed- 
ingly. The idiosyncrasies of the forecastle are many, and 
one can readily sympathize with the feelings of the Judge 
who was so much puzzled by Jack's evidence, which Mr. 
Clark Russell- speaks of in his humorous preface to his 
book on " Sailors' Language." 

A man must go to sea to understand (as a sailor), the 
shades of signification in the terms ; no books give them, 
they cannot be mastered by listening to seamen talking, 
and to seek for an explanation of any nautical phrase 
which strikes one as being peculiar, is only to let oneself 
deeper and deeper into the mire. Therefore, if the words 
Jack sets to his music seem wanting in meaning and lacking 
in sense, we must attribute it to the difference that exists 
between the seamen's mode of expressing themselves and 
ours. The sailor does not lack for singing ; he sings at 
certain parts of his work indeed he must sing if he would 
work. 

On vessels of war, the drum, fife, or boatswain's whistle 
furnish the necessary movement regulator. There is a vast 
difference between the merchant sailor and his fellow " salt," 
the man-o'-war's man, whom they call "Johnny Haul- 
taut," or " John o' Fight." They hold each other in mutual 
derision, although without any unfriendly feeling. Accus- 
tomed to the comparative independence and free life of a 
merchant-vessel, they look with scorn on the binding disci- 
pline and severe penalties of a man-o'-war, and laugh 
contemptuously as they watch the crew in uniform dress 
walk round the windlass, and weigh anchor like mechanical 
dummies : 

" Your work is very hard, my boys, 

Upon the ocean sea, 
And for your reefing topsails, 

I'd rather you as me 
I feather my oar unto the shore, 
So happy as I be in the Guard-ship, ho ! " 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



No hearty chanties there no fine chorus ringing with feel- 
ing and sentiment, brought out with the sort of despairing 
wildness, which so often strikes neighbouring landsfolk 
with the deepest emotion. He likes to growl and he may, 
so long as he goes about his work. I have heard mates 
say, " Give me a man that can growl : the more he growls, 
the more he works." Silence reigns supreme aboard a 
Queen's ship ; no general order is given by word of mouth, 
the boatswain's whistle takes its place. There, where the 
strength of one or two hundred men can be applied at one 
and the same effort, the labour is not intermittent, but con- 
tinuous. The men form on either side of the rope to be 
hauled, and walk away with it like firemen marching with 
their engine, when the headmost pair bring up at the 
stern or bow, they part, and the two streams flow back to 
the starting-point outside the following files. Thus in 
this perpetual " follow my leader way " the work is done, 
with more precision and steadiness than in the merchant 
service. In it the heavier work is done by each man 
doing his utmost at the same moment. This is regulated 
by the " Chanty," and here is the true singing of the deep 
sea it is not recreation, it is an essential part of the work. 
It will masthead the topsail-yards, on making sail ; it will 
start the anchor, ride down the main-tack with a will, it 
will break out and take on board cargo, and keep the pumps 
going. A good voice and a stirring chorus are worth an 
extra man. 

A writer in the St. James's Gazette of December 6th, 
1884, says: "The beau-ideal chanty-man has been rele- 
gated to the past. His death-knell was the shriek of the 
steam-whistle, and the thump of the engines. When he 
flourished British ships were manned by British seamen, 
and carried much stronger crews in proportion to their 
tonnage than their successors. In those days gipsy- 
winches, patent windlasses and capstans, had no existence, 
and the heaving and hauling had to be performed by 
manual strength and labour ; and to make the work ' go ' 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



lighter, the chanty-man chanted his strange lays, while the 
tars with hearty good-will joined in the refrains and 
choruses. Lieutenant Bassett, in his ' Legends and Super- 
stitions of the Sea and of Sailors in all Lands and at all 
Times/ says : ' The old type of sailor, who believed in the 
mermaid, the sea-snake, and the phantom ship, is fast 
disappearing, and, with the gradual substitution of the 
steamship for the sailing-vessel, he is being replaced by the 
mechanical seaman, who sees no spectre in the fog, nor 
sign of disaster in the air or beneath the wave.' " 

Lieutenant Bassett's work is such an inexhaustible 
collection of sea legends and sailors' superstitions, that I 
feel it would be indeed unnecessary for me here to supple- 
ment it with any additional remarks concerning these same 
legends. Any one interested in the subject cannot do 
better than read it. Old tars tell us that the chanties are 
not what they were before steam became so universal : one 
added, on telling me this, u I'll tell you what it is, Miss, 
steamboats have not only taken the wind out of our sails, 
but they have taken the puff out of us too, and them as 
remembers ship-life as it was, will scarcely recognize it 
now-a-days." This advocate of the old school was one of 
many " old salts " whose acquaintance I made, and who 
goodnaturedly sang for me several of their best-remembered 
chanties in a Sailors' Home in the North of England. I 
was very agreeably surprised at the effect of some of these 
chanty choruses ; some of the men present had really good 
voices, and they sang with a life and spirit, and with as 
much rhythmical accuracy as though they were miles 
away on the briny ocean " heaving the windlass round, or 
hoisting the ponderous anchor." 

Whilst on the subject of Sailors' Homes, I should like to 
digress for just one moment to express my cordial thanks 
to all those connected with the institutions that have so 
greatly helped me in the matter of collecting these chanties. 
To the Secretaries, Missionaries, and sailor inmates of 
many of the English Homes, I am indebted for much of 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



the information I have obtained. My thanks are also due 
in a great measure in many other directions in so many, 
indeed, that I feel I have not here adequate space to 
express them, and I trust to be able to tender them fully 
and in detail at some other time. 

There are several kinds of chanty, though I believe, 
properly speaking, they should only be divided into two 
classes, namely, those sung at the capstan and those sung 
when hauling on a rope : but there are, over and above 
these, pumping songs pumping being part of the daily 
morning duty of a well-disciplined merchant-vessel, just a 
few minutes' spell to keep the vessel free and the cargo 
unharmed by bilge-water ; it is not a dismal sound at all, 
rather a lively one, on the contrary. There are also chanties 
used when holy-stoning the decks, and when stowing 
away the cargo ; and indeed I think one may safely con- 
clude that every one of Jack's duties, from Monday morn- 
ing to Saturday night, is done to some sort of music, and 
according to the Philadelphia catechism his labours do not 
end then, for in it we are taught that 

" Six days shalt thou labour and do all thou art able, 
And on the seventh, holy-stone the deck and clean-scrape 
the cable." 

There is one job that sailors seldom fail to get, even when 
the weather is such as to prevent other work being done, 
and that is holy-stoning the decks. The men have to 
kneel down and push backwards and forwards a good- 
sized stone (usually sandstone), the planks being pre- 
viously wetted and sprinkled with sand. From the fact 
of kneeling to it, this unpleasant task is known at sea 
under the title of " saying prayers." 

There is also, besides the chanties, another class of 
song, half of the sea and half of the shore, which I men- 
tioned in the introduction to this collection. They include 
those the fishermen and coasters croon in their lonely 
watches ; the latter in his brief walk, "three steps and

overboard," as he tramps up [and down his little deck 
through the swathing mists of a Bank fog ; and those of 
the cook at his galley fire sung in doleful unison with his 
bubbling coppers. The legend of Captain Cottington, for 
instance, belongs to this class of songs. It is probably 
traditionally known to the young gentlemen at Harvard 
College, and is perhaps most remarkable as a bold and 
ingenious metrical novelty ; one verse will, I have no 
doubt, serve to show the animated tenor of the words. 
The music I must refrain from giving, as I feel utterly 
at a loss how best to represent the extraordinary variety 
of style that pervades the whole ; doubtless a mistake in 
the notation might prove a relief, but I should be tempted 
to commit so many that I am afraid to undertake it 
at all. 

" Captain Cottington, he went to sea, 
Captain Cottington, he went to sea, 
Captain Cottington, he went to sea-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e, 
Captain Cottington, he went to sea," 

and so on, ad libitum. 

There is yet another of these crooning songs, namely, 
" The Rhyme of Uncle Peleg." I believe I am not wrong 
in stating that this is an historical ballad ; indeed, I quite 
believe that, from what I have been able to learn of sailors' 
songs in general, most of them, however degenerate they 
may have become in the course of time and in many cases 
they have certainly descended to a level of utterly maudlin 
sentiment have originally been tales of some heroic 
exploit, or eulogies on some bygone naval genius. 
It is Macaulay, I think, who says that, " A people which 
takes no pride in the noble achievements of remote 
ancestors, will never achieve anything worthy to be re- 
membered by remote descendants with pride. It is a 
sentiment which essentially belongs to the higher and 
purer part of human nature, and which adds not a little to 
the strength of states." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



Our blue-jackets appear to possess this sentiment of 
hero-worship to a very large extent, if one may judge by 
the songs and yarns that find most favour with them. 

In the capstan chanties the metre is generally long, and 
they are of a more pathetic nature than the hauling ones. 
To those who have heard it as the men run round the cap- 
stan, bringing up the anchor from the English mud of a 
ship outward bound for a two or three years' trip, perhaps 
never to return, what can be more sad or touching, 
although sung with a hearty good-will, than " Yo, heave 
ho!"

or such words as : 

" To the Liverpool Docks we'll bid adieu ; 
To Suke, and Sally, and Poll too ; 
The anchor's weighed, the sails unfurled ; 
We are bound to cross the watery world. 
Hurrah ! we're outward bound ! 
Hurrah ! we're outward bound ! " 

Liverpool, as the sailing-point and homeward goal of so 
many vessels, naturally figures very prominently in the 
sailors' chanties, and the air of romance that attaches 
itself to California, the Brazils, and Mexico also seems to 
have a peculiar charm for Jack. He has another outward- 
bound song something to this effect : 



10 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



" Steer, boys, steer, for California, O! 
There's plenty of gold in the land, I'm told, 
On the banks of the Sacramento." 

Another outward-bound chanty is "To Rio Grande we're 
bound away ;" the tune of this last-named is very mournful, 
as will be found in the fews bars of the melody which 
follows :

American vessels, I think, may be charged with the 
following, which are all capstan chanties, " Oceanida," 
"Johnny's Gone," " The Black Ball Line," and " Slapander- 
gosheka/' the last-named with the incomprehensible title 
is addressed " To all you ladies now on land," and may be 
said to be slightly egotistical ; it commences 

" Have you got, lady, a daughter so fair ? 

Slapandergosheka, 

That is fit for a sailor that has crossed the Line ? 
Slapandergosheka." 

By the foregoing it will be seen that Jack sometimes "fancies 
himself," and is not always blind to his own merits. 

It is almost impossible to discover which are British and 
which American, amongst the chanties, they are so mixed 
up with each other, and any which may formerly have 
been characteristic of the one country, have become so 
cosmopolitan, that the sailors themselves have been unable 
to discriminate between them. I have, therefore, acting 
upon some very reliable advice, thought it better to classify 
under one heading all chanties with English words, 
although there are many cases where the nationality is 
beyond doubt. Coloured men being, as a rule, such good 
singers and ingenious poets, may be credited with many ; 
and most probably "Slapandergosheka 1 was first pro- 
nounced by some more than usually clever nigger. One 
of the best known of the capstan chanties is " Haul the 



Music OF THE WATERS. 13 

bowline." When a ship is tacking, the tacks and sheets 
are let run in order that the yards may be swung round to 
meet the altered position of the ship. They must then be 
hauled taut again, and secured, in order to keep the sails 
in their place, and to prevent them from shaking when the 
ship's head comes up in the wind ; the sail is for a moment 
or two edgewise to it, and then is the nice moment, as soon 
as the head-sails fairly fill, when the main-yard and the 
yards above it can be swung readily, and the tacks and 
sheets hauled in. If the crew are too few in number, or 
too slow at their work, and the sails get fairly filled on the 
new tack, it is a fatiguing piece of work enough to " board " 
the tacks and sheets ; you pull at one end of the rope and 
the gale tugs at the other. The advantages of lungs are 
all against you, and perhaps the only thing to be done is 
to put the helm down a little, and set the sails shaking 
again before they can be trimmed properly. If the watch 
on deck has not been over spry, the consequence is that 
the big main is slatting and flying out overhead with a 
might that shakes the ship from stem to stern. The 
flapping of the mad canvas will be like a giant's fist thump- 
ing on a drum. The sheets will be jerking at the belaying- 
pins, the blocks rattling in sharp, castanet-like snappings. 
The sea is lashing and seething alongside in white particles 
of phosphorescent foam, whilst overhead all is black with 
the flying scud. All the most forcible expressions that 
can be thought of may be used without avail, the sail 
won't come. " Then give us the song, men," sings out the 
mate at last. " Pull with a will," " Together, men ! Alto- 
gether, now ! " And then a voice will strike up

At the last word every man will throw his whole strength 
into the pull, all singing it in chorus, quickly and explo- 
sively, and so jump by jump, the sheet will be hauled taut 
at last. This very practical and certainly nautical ex- 
planation of the use of a capstan chanty I found in an old 
number of Chamber J Journal, to whose clever and in- 
structive columns I owe many hints on the subject of 
sailors and their songs.

Much care was evidently given to " Lowlands " by the 
chanty-men. It has often been improved. In its original 
form the first chorus was shorter and less striking:, and the

day."

Chorus. Lowlands, Lowlands, a-ray. 
Of the same general character as " Lowlands," though in- 
ferior to it, is the song that was usually known as "Across the 
Western Ocean." There are several variations of the second 
chorus, none of which could be called improvements.

sailors' songs. Who Stormy was, and why he received 
that evident nickname, even the most profound and learned

The oldest of these songs is rather the best of them. 
The second one contains a hint of decidedly negro origin 
in the word " Massa," and suggests that perhaps the 
legend of " Stormy " is an African rather than a nautical 
myth.

I dug his grave with a silver spade, 
I hove him up with an iron crane, 
And lowered him down with a golden chain 
Old Storm Along is dead and gone. 
Chorus. Ay ! ay ! ay ! Mr. Storm Along. 
Each line is repeated twice. The solemnity of the air 
and the mock-seriousness of the words have a most 
comical effect, and reminded me very much, when I heard 
them sung, of the tale of " The Death of Cock Robin," the 
well-known favourite of the children's picture-books. I 
have since come across a somewhat different version of 
the words of this chanty, in which " Stormy " was written 
" Starmy," and of which the ending was 

Solo. We carried him along to London town, 
Chortis. Starm Along, boys, Starm Along. 

Solo. We carried him away to Mobille Bay, 
Chorus. Starm Along, boys, Starm Along. 

HAULING CHANTIES. 

Of these, there is first the hand-over-hand song, in very 
quick time ; then the long-pull song, when there are, per- 
haps, twenty or thirty men pulling on a rope. To be 
effective, the pull must be made unanimously. This is 
secured by the chanty, the pulling made at some parti- 
cular word in the chorus. For example, in the following 
verse the word "handy "is the signal, at each repetition, 
for a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together : 
Chorus. Oh, shake her up, and away we'll go, 

So handy, my girls, so handy ; 
Up aloft from down below, 

So handy, my girls, so handy. 

For heavier work, or where hands are few, one of longer 
metre is used, such as " O Long Storm, storm along, 
Stormy," which must not, however, be confounded with 
the capstan chanty, " Old Storm Along."

Music OF THE WATERS. 



One of the best and jolliest quick-time songs, and cer- 
tainly one of the most well-known, is " Blow the Man 
Down." It is very tuneful, and though, perhaps, the words 
are scarcely to be admired, still it is a genuine chanty, 
and has a verve and vigour about it that speak of its value 
as an incentive to the labour of hoisting the topsail-yards 
or any other hauling work : 



SOLO. 




I'm a true Eng-lish sail - or, Just come from Hong- Kong, Tib -by, 

1PJ 



Heigh, ho, blow the man down ! My stay on the old Eng- lish 




shore won't be long, Than give me some time to blow the man down. 
CHORUS. 



Then we'll blow the man up, and we'll blow the man down, Tib - by !

So/o. As I was a-walking down Winchester Street 
Heigh-ho, blow the man down ; 
A pretty young girl I happened to meet, 
Oh, give me some time to blow the man down. 
Chorus So we'll blow the man up, and we'll blow the 

man down, 
Heigh-ho, blow the man down.

" Reuben Ranzo " is, perhaps, the greatest favourite 
with the men of all the chanties. The tune is mournful 
and almost haunting in its monotony :

the solo is also repeated.

Solo. He learnt to write on Wednesday, 
He learnt to fight on Thursday, 
On Friday he beat the master, 
On Saturday we lost Reuben, 
And where do you think we found him ? 
Why, down in yonder valley, 
Conversing with a sailor. 
He shipped on board of a whaler ; 
He shipped as able seamen do ; 
Oh, pity Reuben Ranzo. 
The captain was a bad man, 
He took him to the gangway, 
And gave him five-and-forty. 
The mate he was a good man, 
He taught him navigation ; 
Now he's captain of a whaler, 
And married the captain's daughter, 
And now they both are happy.

This ends my little ditty. 
Chorus. Ranzo, boys, a Ranzo ! 
Belay there, lads, belay. 

There is yet another song which has for hero this same 
mysterious and unsailorlike personage, though the cohe- 
rency of the foregoing is not adopted in the second song. 
The word " hilo," which is here introduced, is a word of 
fathomless meaning. There is a very humorous descrip- 
tion of this chanty given by a writer in Harper's Magazine 
(July, 1882), in an article on sailors' songs; he says: 
" Perhaps Max Miiller could attach some meaning to 
' hilo/ but in that case he would do more than any sailor 
ever did. It will not do to suggest that it is really two 
words ' high ' and * low.' It occurs in too many other 
songs, as an active verb, to leave us any room to doubt 
that to ' hilo ' was to be, to do, or to suffer something. It 
cannot be gathered from the insufficient data at our com- 
mand, whether or not the act of ' hiloing ' was commendable 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



21 



in a sailor ; but from the frequency with which the fair sex 
was exhorted in song to ' hilo,' it is evident that it was 
held to be a peculiarly graceful act when executed by a 
young girl." 

I have a song amongst my collection entitled " Tommy's 
gone to ' Hilo,' " which again upsets the theory that " hilo" 
was an active verb ; at least, in this instance, it rises to the 
dignity of a proper noun :

And sing hi - lo, my Rand - so, way. 

On the whole, Reuben Ranzo's nautical career seems 
scarcely to have been a bed of roses. It is really much to 
be wondered at wherein the great fancy for this most ridicu- 
lous song lies. There is not one line of sense in the whole. 

There is another topsail-yard chorus something like 
this : 

Solo. There once was a family living on a hill, 

And if they're not dead they're living there still. 
Chorus. Up, up, my boys, up a hill ; 
Up, up, my boys, up a hill. 

And it is sung to the tune of " Blow the man down." 
Then there is the well-known topsail-halyard song, " Sally 
Racket," greatly used by the sailors when loading their 
ships with timber at Quebec. In this chanty some of the 
lines are much longer than others, and to any one not

acquainted with Jack Tar's style of singing, it would seem 
impossible to make them come in, but the sailors seem to 
be able to manage it. Like " Reuben Ranzo/' the solo 
lines of Sally Racket are always repeated, the same chorus 
occurring after each solo line : 

SOLO. CHORUS. SOLO.

Chorus. Cheerily, cheerily, men. 

Solo. And burn the ticket, hoy oh*. 
Chorus. Cheerily, cheerily, men. 
(Spoken) That'll do, boys. 

The words at the end of the song are spoken by the man in 
charge of the work mate, second mate, or boatswain. In 
the chorus the word u men " is accented by the pull ; and 
in the solo lines the word " oh " is where another pull is 
taken. 

I am told that the oldest chanty on record is one that 
goes by the name of " Cheerily, men ; oh holly, hi-ho, 
cheerily, men." But at what time, in what place it is used 
or I should say, was used, for I think it is almost obsolete 
now I cannot say. It is, however, a typical specimen of 
an English sailor-song of a remote period, for undoubtedly 
many of the sailor-songs are of negro origin. They are 
the reminiscences of melodies sung by negroes stowing 
cotton in the holds of ships in Southern ports. The 
" chanty-men " have, to some extent, kept to the silly 
words of the negroes, and have altered the melodies to suit 
their purposes. 

Any quick, lively tune, to which you might work a fire- 
engine, will serve for the music of a pumping song. The 
words vary with every fancy. " Pay me the money down " 
is a very favourite pumping chorus. Somehow thus the 
verse runs (it is known as an English comic song) : 

Solo. Your money, young man, is no object to me. 
Chorus. Pay me the money down. 

Solo. Half-a-crown's no great demand. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



Chorus. Pay me the money down. 
Solo & Chorus. Money down, money down ; 
Pay me the money down. 

It seems a very strange song for men so little given to 
avarice as sailors are. Their parting ceremony on embark- 
ing is usually to pitch their last shilling on to the wharf, 
to be scrambled for by the land-sharks. Nor yet does 
there seem much sense in it, but it serves to man and 
move the brakes merrily. The following tune is sometimes 
used for this chanty : 

PADDLE YOUR OWN CANOE. 




There is a rollicking, lively chorus of 

Chorus. Highland day and off she goes, 

Off she goes with a flying foretopsail, 
Highland day and off she goes. 

RUN, LET THE BULL CHIMES RUN. 




This is another favourite pumping song : 

Chorus. Run, let the bull chimes run, 
Chorus. We'll run, 

Solo. Away to America. 
Chorus. Way aha, way aha ! 
Way aha, way aha ! 
Chorus. We'll pump her dry and get our grog. 

Solo. Run, let the bull chimes run.

Chorus. We'll pump her dry and away we'll go, 
Solo. Away to America ! 

THE LION MAN-O'-WAR. 

A very popular song at Portsmouth is "The Lion 
Man-o'-War." The following are a few of the words : 

" Are you the Lion man-o'-war, as we suppose you be ?" 
" We are the Lion man-o'-war, as you shall quickly see." 
" Then haul your colours from the mast, and come along 

with me, 
Or we'll sink the Lion man-o'-war at the bottom of the sea."

HOME, DEARIE, HOME. 

Amongst the favourite chanties of North-country sailors 
is that most charming and pathetic of songs, " Home, 
Dearie, Home :" 

Solo. Oh, Amble is a fine town, with ships in the bay, 
And I wish with my heart I was only there to-day ; 
I wish with my heart I was far away from here, 
A-sitting in my parlour, and talking to my dear.

Chorus. And it's home, dearie, home ! oh, it's home I want 

to be. 

My topsails are hoisted, and I must out to sea,

tree, 

They're all a-growin' green in the North-countree ; 
Oh, it's home, dearie, home ! oh, it's home I want

Solo. Oh, there's a wind that blows, and it's blowing 

from the West, 
And of all the winds that blow 'tis the one I like

And it soon will blow us home to the North-

Chorus. And it's home, dearie, home ! oh, it's home I want

Another very favourite song with the Northern seamen 
is " The Spanish Canoe," somewhat in the same style as 
the capstan song of " Lowlands : "

Oh, I've got a ship in the North Coun-tree, She 



goes by the name of the Gold -en Van - i - tee; I

_ 



sink her in the Low - lands low. 



Low - lands, 



Low-lands, They'll sink her in the Low- lands, low. 

There is also a " Homeward Bound " song very well known 
to them : 



28 Music OF THE WATERS. 

" At Catherine's Dock I bade adieu 
To Poll and Bet, and lovely Sue ; 
The anchor's weighed, the sails unfurled, 
We're bound to plough the watery world ; 
Don't you see we're outward bound. 

But when we come back to Catherine's Docks, 

The pretty girls they come in flocks ; 

And Bet to Poll and Sue will say 

4 Oh, here comes Jack, with his three years' pay ;' 

Don't you see we're homeward bound ? 

Then we all set off to the ' Dog and Bell,' 
Where the best of liquor they always sell ; 
In comes old Archy, with a smile, 
Saying ' Drink, my lads, it's worth your while ; ' 
Don't you see we're homeward bound ? " 

The chanty known by the name of " Whisky for my 
Johnny," or "Whisky Johnny," has many different verses, 
all more or less bearing upon the same subject, and none 
betraying much delicacy or refinement of expression. It 
has been sent to me from several different quarters where 
I have applied for chanties, so I conclude from this fact, 
that it must be fairly well known amongst the sailors, 
and may be even a great favourite. As I have before re- 
marked, the sailors' songs are truly characteristic of the 
men they belong to, and so long as they adapt themselves 
to the purpose for which they are intended, and help to 
lighten the labour and regulate the work at sea, we must 
be content to take them as they are, and not look for 
drawing-room rose-water sentiment in the ideas that 
originate and find favour amongst the hardy toilers of the 
briny ocean.

Belay is generally said when the song comes to an end, or 
" Coil up the ropes there, boys." 



30 Music OF THE WATERS. 

It is not either necessary or would it be interesting for me 
to relate at any length, the manner in which many of these 
chanties have been obtained. I have taken down myself 
the greater part from the sailors ; sometimes at my own 
house, sometimes at one of theirs, occasionally in a hospital, 
or on board ship. There have been difficulties often in my 
way, in spite of the great kindness I have everywhere had 
shown me, but I have never had the experience of one of 
my numerous correspondents namely that of having the 
chanties sung to him sotto voce. It appears that he, like 
many others, had entertained the idea of collecting the 
Sailors' songs and had accordingly made a beginning, which 
he has since handed over to me. " I was," he says, " some 
time ago making a ninety days' voyage in an old ' sailer' 
and as a pastime I commenced what you have since so ably 
completed, the task of making a collection of the working 
songs of the sea. I took notes of the best of the capstan 
and other songs included in the repertoire of our not very 
large crew. At first I jotted down the words and music 
in my note-book while the men were actually hauling at 
the ropes but this method promised to yield as many 
versions of each song as there were sailors (for each man 
had his own pet way of leading), so that I was constrained to 
try some other plan. It was this. I selected the most vocal 
of the crew a splendid fellow, as supple as a panther, and 
first at everything. He visited me in my cabin at stated 
moments, and as his presence was a grave breach of the 
rules, he had, like Bottom, to * roar him as gently as any 
sucking dove.' In a word the songs were given out in a 
sort of roaring whisper, or whispering roar, which greatly 
exercised the curiosity of the passengers in the adjacent 
saloon. Even this chosen songster proved untrue to himself 
and gave me the same song in different ways, at different 
times, and this accounts, no doubt, for the discrepancies 
that exist between some of the songs as given by you, and 
as taken by myself." I believe it is for this reason, that the 
chanties have remained so long uncollected. Of course, I 



Music OF THE WATERS. 31 

have found these same discrepancies over and over again, 
and many times have almost given up the idea of the col- 
lection, in consequence. It is the same amongst all nations 
of sailors. The writer of the letter just referred to, sent 
me some of the chanties he had taken down in secret in 
his cabin, and the versions both of music and words are 
different to mine. For instance, " Whisky Johnny " he gives 
as " Whisky " (hauling chanty), and though the sentiment 
is the same he gives it in quite other words : 

Solo. O ! Whisky is the life of man, 

Chorus. Whisky, Johnny ! 

I drink whisky when I can, 

Chorus. O ! Whisky for my Johnny. 
Solo. I drink it out of an old tin can. 
Whisky killed my poor old dad, 
Whisky drove my mother mad, 
Whisky caused me much abuse, 
Whisky put me in the Calabouse, 
Whisky fills a man with care, 
Whisky makes a man a bear. 

The tune is also different, so I give that to which these 
words were sung. A query is appended to " Whisky" as to 
whether it be an anacreontic or a teetotal hymn ? The 
sentiment is mixed, and it might serve for both. 

SOLO. CHORUS. 




CHORUS. 







He gives the same melody as I have done for " Blow 
the Man Down," but different lines. 

I. " Blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down ; 
Blow the man down, bullies, pull him around. 



32 Music OF THE WATERS. 

2. Blow the man down, you darlings, lie down, 
Blow the man down for fair London town. 

3. When the Black Bailer is ready for sea, 
That is the time that you see such a spree. 

4. There's tinkers, and tailors, and soldiers, and all, 
They all ship for sailors on board the Black Ball. 

5. When the Black Bailer hauls out of the dock, 

To see these poor fellows, how on board they flock. 

6. When the Black Bailer gets clear of the land, 

'Tis then you will hear the great word of command. 

7. * Lay aft here, ye lubbers, lay aft, one and all, 

I'll none of your dodges on board the Black Ball' 

8. To see these poor devils, how they will all 'scoat/ 
Assisted along by the toe of a boot. 

9. It's now we are sailing on th' ocean so wide, 

Where the deep and blue waters dash by our black side. 

10. It's now when we enter the channel so wide, 
All hands are ordered to scrub the ship's side. 

1 1. And now, my fine boys, we are round the rock, 
And soon, oh ! soon, we will be in the dock. 

12. Then all our hands will bundle ashore, 
Perhaps some will never to sea go more." 

Chorus. Wae ! Hae ! Blow the man down, 

Give me some time to blow the man down. 

"Reuben Ranzo"(a true story?), of course is given in 
yet another form, both as regards music and poetry ; this 
favourite hauling chanty seems to have as many different 
versions as a pickpocket has aliases. The remark made 
by the collector on this song is worth remembering ; he 
says, " Ranzo is suspiciously like a ' crib ' from a well- 
known old sea-song concerning a certain ' Lorenzo/ who 
also ' was no sailor.' However the versions of Reuben 
Ranzo may alter one salient point in each remains, and 
that is the fact of ' his being no sailor.' " The last lines of 
this poem run : 



MUSTC OF THE WATERS. 33 

" I wish I was old ' Ranzo's ' son." 
Chorus. Ranzo, boys, Ranzo. 

" I'd build a ship of a thousand ton ; 
I'd give my sailors plenty of rum. 1 
Old ' Ranzo ' was a good old man, 
But now old ' Ranzo's ' dead and gone, 
And none can sing his funeral song." 

The next song, " Tommy's gone to Hilo," is one of the 
mournful style of chanties, with a very long dragging 

chorus.

1 Truly " a fellow-feeling makes us wondrous kind." Old " Ranzo " 
is a personage that is not mentioned in other accounts of his son's 
life, but both pere et fils appear to be personages in nautical history 
whom "not to know is to argue oneself unknown."

Like most chanties, the lines of " Tommy's gone to 
Hilo" are repeated every time, the chorus being the same

The pull is made on the word " Hilo." 

The following song was written down for me by a sailor. 
He is also responsible for the tune, which to my great 
astonishment, he wrote out. He told me that it was 
a favourite as a forecastle song, and was always received 
with enthusiasm at concerts on board ship. The chorus is 
set to " Rule Britannia," and as the words are really funny, 
I do not wonder at its popularity :

of light, 

To the bottom of the deep blue sea. 
Singing 

Chorus. Rule Britannia. 

Solo. We lowered a boat to look after him, 
And we thought to find his corpse, 
When up to the top he came with a bang, 
And sung in a voice sepulchrally hoarse 
" My comrades and my messmates all, 
Pray do not grieve for me, 
For I'm married to a mermaid 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea." 

Chorus. Rule Britannia. 

Solo. He told us how when he first went down 
The fishes all came round he, 
And they seemed to think, as they stared at 

him, 

That he made uncommonly free. 
But down he went, tho' he didn't know how, 
And he felt " it's all up with me," 
When he came to a lovely mermaid 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea. 
Singing

And gave him her wet white hand, 
Saying, " Long have I waited for you, my dear, 
You are welcome safe to land. 
Go back to your messmates for the last time, 
And tell them all from me, 
That you're married to a mermaid 
At the bottom of the deep blue sea." 

CJwrus. Rule Britannia. 

Solo. And the anchor was raised and the sails un- 
furled, 

And the ship was running free, 

When up we went to our captain, 

And this we told to he.

side, 

And out .loud bellowed he 

" Be as happy as you can with your wife, my 
man, 

(There's no divorce court) At the bottom of

Chorus. Rule Britannia. 

The words " there's no divorce court " are spoken. 

The following song is perhaps the only sailor-song which 
has ever been made to do duty on a minstrel stage. The

" Allan Dale," but there seems nothing to warrant this idea.

" Highland Day and off she goes," may be more likely " Hi-

A YANKEE SHIP. 




A Yankee ship came down the river, 

Blow, boys, blow. 

A Yankee ship came down the river, 

Blow, my bully boys, blow. 

And who do you think was skipper of her ? 

And who do you think was skipper of her ? 

Dandy Jim from old Carolina, 
Chorus. Blow, my bully boys, blow. 
Solo. Dandy Jim from old Carolina, 

And who do you think was second greaser ? 

Why, Pompey Squash that big buck nigger, 

And what do you think they had for dinner ? 

Monkey's lights and donkey's liver, 

And what do you think they had for supper ? 

Hard tack and Yankee leather, 

Then blow, my boys, for better weather, 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. Then blow, my boys, for better weather, 
Chorus. Blow, my bully boys, blow. 

Solo. What do you think was the name of this clipper ? 

The Flying Cloud, with a cranky skipper, 

Then up aloft that yard must go, 

One more pull and then belay, 

I think I heard our old man say, 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. He set more sail and give her way, 

We'll hoist it high before we go, 
Another good pull and make it stay, 

And then we've finished for to-day, 
And then we've finished for to-day, 
Chorus. Blow, my bully boys, blow. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



This chanty is sometimes called " Blow, boys, blow/' and 
the verses vary, not so much in the theme or the locale, 
which is always America, but in the dramatis persons. 
For instance, in one version I found 

Solo. Who do you think was captain of her ? 
Who do you think was captain of her ? 
Old John Brown, the boarding master, 
Old John Brown, the boarding master, 
Who do you think was looking after ? 
Who. do you think was looking after ? 
Cock-eyed Bill, the West-end barber, 
Cock-eyed Bill, the West-end barber. 

In another 

Solo. Oh blow, my boys, I long to hear you. 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. A Yankee Liner coming down the river. 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. And how do you know she's a Yankee Liner ? 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. By the stars and stripes- she hangs behind her. 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. A Colonial packet coming down the river. 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. How do you know she's a Colonial packet? 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

Solo. She fired a gun, I heard the racket. 
Chorus. Blow, boys, blow. 

And so on. This version was given me by a young Scotch- 
man, whose time at sea had been limited to fifteen months, 
nevertheless he had a very intimate knowledge of ship- 
life, and sailors' ways and songs, and was furthermore 
possessed of a good voice and a better ear ; he sang several 
chanties for me, and acted, as far as he was able in a 
drawing-room, the heaving and hauling which they accom- 
panied.

" The exploits of the early American Navy," says The 
New York Tribune, "can be read on the cold pages of 
history, but nowhere do they live with such freshness and 
vigour as in the rude naval songs composed at the time 
when Paul Jones, Decatur, Hull and Pessy filled the annals 
of the sea ' with the splendid tumult of their deeds.' There 
is one old song called the * Yankee Man-of-war,' descriptive 
of the cruise of John Paul Jones in the Irish Channel in 
1778. The air is peculiarly nautical in its character, and 
the words are vigorous and full of life. The first and last 
stanzas are as follows : 

" 'Tis of the gallant Yankee ship 

That flew the stripes and stars, 
And the whistling wind from the west-nor'-west 

Blew through the pitch-pine spars. 
With her starboard tacks about, my boys, 

She hung upon the gale ; 
On an autumn night we raised the light 
Of the old Head of Kinsale. 

* * -x- * * 

' Out booms ! out booms ! ' our skipper cried, 
' Out booms, and give her sheet.' 
And the swiftest keel that ever was launched 
Shot ahead of the British fleet. 



42 Music OF THE WATERS. 

And amid a thundering shower of shot, 

With stern-sails hoisted away, 
Down the North Channel Paul Jones did steal 

Just at the break of day." 

In 1813 there was a popular song sung to the tune of 
" Ye Mariners of England," and called " The Freedom of 
the Seas." The chorus is : 

" Though tyrants frown and cannon roar, and angry 

tempests blow, 
We'll be free on the sea in despite of every foe." 

Another song of Paul Jones' victories was sung in 1813, 
descriptive of the Bonhomme Richard overcoming the 
English men-of-war Serapis and Countess of Scarborough 
in 1779. About the same time appeared the glorious old 
ballad of " The Constitution and Guerriere," to which the 
decks of American men-of-war still continue to echo ; " The 
Siege of Tripoli;" and "Yankee Tars." A song of this 
period is called "The Yankee Thunders;" it is largely 
taken up with praises of the bravery of English sailors, and 
intimates that only the Yankees are a match for them. 
The last verse runs 

" Hence be our floating bulwarks 

Those oaks our mountains yield ; 
'Tis mighty Heaven's plain decree, 

Then take the watery field. 
To ocean's furthest barriers, their 

Fair whitening sails shall pour ; 
Safe they'll ride o'er the tide, 

While Columbia's thunders roar, 
While her cannon's fire is flashing past, 

And her Yankee thunders roar." 

In one of Mr. Ballantyne's books," The Red Eric, or the 
Whaler's Last Cruise," there is a song sung by one Gurney, 
when the men on board of this same whaler were grouped 
around the .windlass. On receiving Gurney's promise to 



Music OF THE WATERS. 43 

give them a song, his comrades ask "if there be any chorus 
to it ? " " Ay, in course there is," is his reply. " Wot's a 
song without a chorus ? Wot's plum duff without the 
plums ? What's a ship without the helm ? It's my opinion , 
shipmates, that a song without a chorus is no better than 
it should be. It's wus nor nothin' ! It puts them wot 
listens in the blues, an' the man wot sings into the stews 
an' sarve him right. I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't give the 
fag end o' nothin mixed in a bucket o' salt water for a 
song without a chorus, that's flat ; so here goes ! " 

" Having delivered himself of these opinions in an ex- 
tremely vigorous manner, and announced the fact that he 
was about to begin, Gurney cleared his throat and drew a 
number of violent puffs from his pipe in quick succession, 
in order to kindle that instrument into a glow which would 
last through the first verse and the commencement of the 
chorus. This he knew was sufficient, for the men, when 
once fairly started on the chorus, would infallibly go on to 
the end with or without his assistance, and would there- 
fore afford him time for a few restorative whiffs. 

" ' It bain't got no name, lads.' 

" ' Never mind, Gurney. All right, fire away.' 

Solo. Oh, I once know'd a man as hadn't got a nose, 
An' this is how he came to hadn't 
One cold winter night he went and got it froze ; 
By the pain he was well nigh madden'd. 

Chorus. By the pain he was well nigh madden'd. 

Solo. Next day it swoll up as big as my head, 
An' tough as a junk of leather ; 
(Ah ! he yelled, so he did, fit to pierce ye through), 
An' then it fell off altogether ! 

Chorus. Fell off altogether, 

An' then it fell off altogether. 

Solo. But the morial is wot you've now got to hear, 
An' it's good, as sure as a gun ; 



44 Music OF THE WATERS. 

An' you'll never forget it, my messmates dear, 
For this song it hain't got none. 

Chorus. Hain't got none ; 

For this song it hain't got none. 

" The applause which followed this song was most en- 
thusiastic, and evidently gratifying to Gurney, who assumed 
a modest, deprecatory air, as he proceeded to relight his 
pipe, which had been allowed to go out at the third verse, 
the performer having become so engrossed in his subject as 
to have forgotten the interlude of puffs at that point" 

Mr. Robert C. Leslie, in his " A Sea Painter's Log," says 
of sailors' songs : ?" Years ago, when the (little) Great 
Western was fighting an almost solitary battle of steam 
versus sail power upon the Atlantic, the old Black X sail- 
ing liners were notable for their musical crews ; and capstan 
songs, as they were called, always came rolling aft from a 
liner's forecastle, as the men tramped round winding in the 
warp that was slowly moving her out of dock (all done 
now by rattling, whizzing, steam-winch power). I recollect 
the airs of many of these songs ; but the words, except the 
choruses, were hard to catch, and some of these were coarse, 
or not worth much when caught. The following was 
written down as a very superior piece of poetry, and it was 
sung by a fellow of most ' comly making ' : 

Solo. Late one evening as I vas a valking. 
Chorus. Oh, ho, yes oho. 

Solo. O there I heard a loving couple talking; 
Chorus. A hundred years ago. 

Solo. It was a serious good old woman, 

And she vas a saying of things not common, 
She vas a saying unto her darter, 
O mind, then, vords o' mine herearter ; 
Red-nosed men frequent the ale-'ouse, 
Sandy-'aired men are always jailous ; 
The fat will coax, the lean will flatter, 
Oh, marry none of them, my darter : 



. Music OF THE WATERS. 45 

Solo. But marry a man of a'comly making, 
For in him there's no mistaking : 
In so doing of w'ich you'll please me, 
And so of my troubles ease me. 

" But long before the song reached this point it was 
usually cut short by the mate singing out : * Vast heaving 
there for'ard ; out bass, and lay aft some of ye/ &c. Then 
soon a fresh song would burst from another part of the 
ship ; perhaps the following wild kind of thing :" and Mr. 
Leslie here quotes the sailor's favourite, which I have 
already given, " Old Starm-along." 

In a tale entitled " The Man-o'- War's Man," there are 
some excellent choruses, of which I give a few, as they 
may sometimes be heard sung by our sailors to any tune 
they can be set to : 

Chorus. " O, Greenland is a cold countrie, 
And seldom is seen the sun ; 
The keen frost and snow continually blow, 
And the daylight never is done, 

Brave boys, 
And the daylight never is done." 

Chorus. " Nor never will I married be 
Until the day I die ; 

For the stormy winds and the raging sea 
Parted my love and I." 

Of totally different sentiment is the following : 

Chorus. " O, the rose it is red and the violet is blue, 

And my heart, love, beats steady and constant 

to you, 

Then let it be early, late, or soon, 
I will enjoy my rose in June." 

Chorus. " Farewell and adieu to you, grand Spanish ladies, 
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain, 
For we've received orders to sail for old England, 
But we hope in short time for to see you again." 



46 Music OF THE WATERS. 

The next is a drinking-song : 

Chorus. " Then we'll drink and be jolly, and drown melan- 
choly, 

Our spirits to cherish, our hopes and our lives, 
And we'll pay all our debts with a flying top- 
sail ; 
And so bid adieu to our sweethearts and wives." 

The following is very patriotic : 

Chorus." On the glorious, the second of April, all at the 

dawn of the day, 
We unreefed our topsails, and then we wore 

away ; 

Lord Nelson on the poop did stand, 
With his spy-glass all in his hand, 
And all he said, as we pushed for the land, 
Was, ' Steady, and cheer up, ho.' " 

The following used to be one of the most popular songs 
in the Black X Line. I make no false statement when I 
say that it is true melody, and deservedly popular. The 
words are about as unintelligible as the most of them 
are : 

SOLO. Andante.

Amongst the Southern negroes the name of " Santa 
Anna," the Mexican general, is frequently heard in their 
songs, and the windlass chanty known as " The Plains of

Solo. Oh ! seven long years I courted Sally, 
I mean to marry Sally Brown. 
Oh ! seven long years I courted Sally. 
Chorus. Way ! heigh ! &c. 

The last verse resembles the other version somewhat. 
The verses are not at all times consistent with the next 
song, also a capstan one, and they are too numerous to 
quote in full. 

I give the melody as I got it from a coloured seaman at 
the " Home/' together with a verbatim copy of his verses :

So/o. When I am on a foreign shore, 

I'll think of the wife that I adore. 

Those crosses you see at the bottom of the lines, 

Are only to put me in mind. 

As I was standing on the pier, 

A fair young maid to me appeared. 

As I am standing on a foreign shore, 

I'll drink to the girl that I adore. 

For I'll tell you the truth, and I'll tell you no lie, 

If I don't love that girl I hope I may die. 

Liza Lee, she promised me, 

When I returned she would marry me. 

And now I am on a foreign strand, 

With a glass of whisky in my hand ; 

And I'll drink a glass to the foreign shore, 

And one to the girl that I adore. 

When I am homeward bound again, 

My name I'll publish on the main. 

With a good ship and a jolly crew, 

A good captain and chief mate, too, 

Now fare thee well, fare thee well, 

For sweet news to my girl I'll tell. 

" Haul away." This is a short-rope pulling song of almost 
equal popularity in the olden days with " Haul the Bowline." 
It is one of the most characteristic melodies amongst the 
chanties. At the word "Joe" all hands give a pull. 

" Oh once I had a nigger girl, 

And she was fat and lazy. 

And then I got an Irish girl, 

And she was double-jointed. 

And then I had a Dover lass, 

She ran away with a soldier." 
" Away, haul away Haul away, Joe. 

Away, haul away Haul away, Joe.

a Portsmouth favourite :

=*=f 



Solo. " I'm Handy Jim from Caro-line, 
Chorus. So handy, me boys, so handy." 

(The chorus is throughout the same, and follows each 
line of the solo.) 

Solo. " I courted a girl named Sarah Jane, 
So handy, me boys, so handy. 
Sarah Jane was a kitchen maid, 
And ofttimes into her kitchen I strayed, 
And had a good blow-out of something hot. 
But one fine night, through my good luck, 
The missus came home in the copper I got ; 
But the missus had come the clothes for to wash. 
The fire being lit the copper got hot, 
And the missus she came to stir up the pot, 
And out I jumped, all smoking hot, 
The missus she fainted, and cried ' Stop thief! ' 
But I was off like a shot of a gun. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 53 

Solo. When the missus came to there was an awful row ; 
Poor Sarah, she got the sack next day, 
Then she came to me straightway, and said, 
* I've lost my character, place likewise.' 
Says I, c My dear, now never you mind, 
Next Sunday morn' we'll go and get wed ; ' 
Next Sunday morn' I was at sea instead. 
So now, my boys, when courting you go, 
If the missus turns up, in the copper don't go, 
If you're handy there> you're handier here. 
One more pull, and up she will go, 
The mate cries ' Belay !' so below we will go." 

Verily a moral to other young men than Jack, who go 
courting below stairs ; but let us hope they will not follow 
his bad example and merit the title " Deceivers ever." 

The following " Bonny " is another hauling chanty, 
somewhat after the style of " Whisky Johnny." 

I. Oh, Bonny was a warrior, 
Hae ! Ha ! 



2. Oh, Bonny was no Frenchman, 
Wae ! Hae ! Ha ! 

(Pronounced as " Day," and Ha ! " as " Far.") 

3. Bonny beat the Rooshins, 

4. The Prooshians, and the Osstrians, 

5. At the Battle of Marengo. 

6. Bonny went to Moscow, 

7. Moscow was o'foyre. 1 

8. Bonny lost his army there, 

9. Bonny retreated back again. 

10. Bonny went to Elbow, 2 

11. And soon he did come back again. 

1 Supposed to have some reference to a famous conflagration. 

2 Where is " Elbow '' ? I think it is a sly hit at Bonny's want of 
elbow-room when immured.

3. " Good-morning, Mr. Tap Scott." " Good 

morning, sir," said he. 

" Have you got any ships bound for New York, 
in the States of Amerikey ? " 

4. " Oh, yes ! I have got packet-ships. I have got 

one or two, 
I've got thefosey Walker, besides the Kangaroo. 

5. I've got thefosey Walker, and on Friday she 

will sail, 

With all four hundred emigrants, and a thou- 
sand bags o' mail." 2 

6. Now I am in New York, and I'm walking 

through the street, 

With no money in my pockets, and scarce a 
bit to eat. 

7. Bad luck to Josey Walker, and the day that 

she set sail ! 

For them sailors got drunk, broke into my 
bunk, and stole out all my meal. 3

3 Sufficient provocation to justify this outburst in rhyme.

8. Now I'm in Philadelphia, and working on the canal, 
To go home in one o' them packet-ships, I'm sure 

I never shall.

both steam and sail, 

Where you get soft tack every day, and none of

In this song each line is repeated, so that the anchor 
may be up ere it is finished.

3. It's now we are hauling right out of the dock, 
Where the boys and the girls on the pier-head

downward flow, 

Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the west-

5. Oh, now we are lying in the River Mersey, 
Waiting for the tug-boat to take us to sea.

Mersey does flow,

Our passengers all sick and our new mates all

Where the water is green and the bottom is

A collection of English sailors' songs could scarcely be 
complete without some reference to those which are to be 
found in Shakespeare's " Tempest." Dr. Johnson says of 
the first scene in the first act that " This naval dialogue 
is perhaps the earliest example of sailors' language exhi- 
bited on the stage." The second Lord Mulgrave declared 
that Shakespeare's technical knowledge of seamanship 
must have been " the result of the most accurate personal 
observation." The boatswain in "The Tempest" delivers 
himself in the true vernacular style of the " forecastle." 
Says Captain Glascock, R.N. : " Heigh, my hearts ; cheerily, 
cheerily, my hearts ; yare, yare 1 Take in the topsail." 
" Yare/' meaning quick, ready, is several times used by 
Shakespeare as a sea-term. 

Ariel's beautiful song, " Full Fathom Five," which Ferdi- 
nand describes so graphically " This music crept by me 
upon the waters ; allaying both their fury, and my passion, 
with its sweet air " is too well known for me to do more 
than allude to it. 



Music OF THE WATERS.

" Full fathom five thy father lies ; 

Of his bones are coral made ; 
Those are pearls that were his eyes. 

Nothing of him that doth fade 
But doth suffer a sea-change 
Into something rich and strange. 

Chorus. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell ; 

Hark ! now I hear them ding-dong, bell." 

Then there is Stephano's half-drunken 

" I shall no more to sea, to sea ; 
Here shall I die ashore. 

***** 

The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I, 

The gunner and his mate 
Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery, 

But none of us cared for Kate ; 

For she had a tongue with a tang, 

Would cry to a sailor ' go hang ! ' 

Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang ! " 

Caliban, too, like many a modern tar, has a line or two 
on his past hardships in " The Still-vex'd Bermoothes " : 



60 Music OF THE WATERS. 

" No more dams I'll make for fish ; 
Nor fetch in firing 
At requiring ; 

Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish : 
Ban, Ban, Ca-Caliban, 
Has a new master : get a new man." 

Towards the close of Queen Elizabeth's reign there was 
a grand outburst of sea songs. The pages of Charles 
Kingsley's characteristic novel of that period, " Westward 
Ho ! " abound in the quaint rhymes that were then in 
vogue. Captain Oxenham's " Westward Ho ! with a rum- 
below," seems to set itself to music : 

" For O, 'tis the herrings and the good brown beef, 

And the cider and the cream so white ; 
O, they are the making of the jolly Devon Lads, 
For to play, and eke to fight. 

O, who will join jolly mariners all ? 

And who will join, says he O ! 
To fill his pockets with the good red gold, 

By sailing on the sea O ! 

Our bodies in the sea so deep, 

Our souls in heaven to rest ; 
Where valiant seamen one and all 

Hereafter shall be blest. 

O randy, dandy, dandy O, 

A whet of ale and brandy O ! 
With a rumbelow and a ' westward ho ! ' 

And heave my mariners all O ! " 

Then there is also Father Neptune's famous song, intro- 
duced in this most truly nautical book : 

" See every man the Pelican, 

Which round the world did go, 
While her stern-post was uppermost 
And topmasts down below. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 61 

And by the way they lost a day, 

Out of her log was stole ; 
But Neptune kind, with favouring wind, 

Hath brought her safe and whole. 

I am King Neptune bold, 

The ruler of the seas ; 
I don't understand much singing upon land, 

But I hope what I say will please." 

As might be expected, there is frequent mention of the 
Spaniards in these old Cornish and Devonian songs of 
that period : 

" Oh, where be these gay Spaniards, 
Which make so great a boast O ? 
Oh, they shall eat the grey goose feather, 
And we shall eat the- roast O ! " 

Many of these rattling old sea-songs are sung, and well- 
known too, in Devonshire to this day ; there is one, tf The 
Mermaid," with a splendid chorus : " While we jolly 
sailor-boys were up aloft, And the land-lubbers lying down 
below, below, below." Then there is another, entitled 
"John Dory," and one known as "The Spanish Lady." 
Then again Dr. Boyce's grand song, " Hearts of Oak," 
was written at the end of the eighteenth century ; and 
Davy's celebrated " Bay of Biscay," both illustrative of the 
times of the Elizabethan sea-dogs. 

Some of the old songs of the sea are forecastle favourites 
with the sailors, and may often be heard wherever sailors 
are congregated together. Such songs as " Cawsand Bay," 
" True Blue," &c., are especially popular with Jack. 

CAWSAND BAY. 

(Still sung when ships of war are on distant stations.) 
" In Cawsand Bay lying, with Blue Peter flying, 

And all hands turned up for the anchor to weigh, 
There came a young lady as fresh as a May-day, 

And, modestly hailing, this damsel did say, 



62 Music OF THE WATERS. 

' I wants a young man there, do you hear ? Bear a hand 
there, 

To hoist me aboard, or to send him to me ; 
For his name's Henry Grady, and I am a lady 

Just come to prevent him from going to sea.' 

Then the captain, his honour, when he looked upon her, 
Ran down the ship's side for to help her aboard. 

Says he, with emotion, ' What son of the ocean 
Can thus be looked after by Elinor Ford ? ' 

Then the lady made answer, ' That there is my man, sir, 
I'll make him as fine and as free as a lord. 5 

' No, no/ says the cap'n ' that cannot well happen ; 
I've got sailing orders, you, sir, stay aboard ! ' 

' Avast ! ' says the lady. * Don't hear him, Henry Grady, 
He once was your captain, but now he's at large, 

Don't you stay aboard here, for all that man's order ; ' 
And out of her bosom she hauled his discharge. 

Then the captain says he now, ' I'm blowed but he's free 

now/ 

Says Hal, ' Let old Weatherface keep all my clothes.' 
Ashore then he steered her, and the lads they all cheered 

her ; 
But the captain was jealous, and looked down his nose. 

****** 

Then she got a shore tailor to rig her young sailor 
With tight nankeen breeches and blue long-tailed coat, 

And he looked like a squire, for all to admire, 

With his dimity handkerchief tied round his throat. 

And they had a house greater than e'er a first-rater, 
With servants in uniform handing the drink, 

And a garden to go in, with flowers a-blowin' 
The daisy, the buttercup, lily and pink. 

And he got education quite fit for his station, 
For you know we are never too old for to larn ; 



Mi 7 sic OF THE WATERS. 63 

And his messmates they found him with youngsters around 

him, 
All chips of the old block from the stem to the starn." 

FAREWELL TO YOU, YE FINE SPANISH 

LADIES. 

Mr. Chappell, in his invaluable " Music of the Olden 
Time," gives the tune and six verses of this old sea-song 
which I here quote ; the date of it is uncertain. Captain 
Marryat gives the verses in his " Poor Jack": 

" Now farewell to you, ye fine Spanish ladies, 

Now farewell to you, ye ladies of Spain, 
For we've received orders to sail for old England, 

And perhaps we may never more see you again. 

We'll range and we'll rove like true British sailors ; 

We'll range and we'll rove all on the salt seas ; 
Until we strike soundings in the Channel of England, 

From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues. 

We hove our ship to, with the wind at sou'west, boys, 
We hove our ship to, for to strike soundings clear, 

Then filled the main top-sail, and bore right away, boys, 
And straight up the Channel our course we did steer. 

The first land we made, it is called the Dead-man, 

Next, Ram Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland, and 
Wight. 

We sailed by Beachy, by Fairly, and Dungeness, 
And then bore away for the South Foreland Light. 

Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor, 

All in the downs that night for to sleep ; 
Now stand by your stoppers, see clear your shank painters, 

Haul up your clew garnets, stick out tacks and sheets. 

Now let ev'ry man toss off a full bumper, 

Now let ev'ry man take off his full bowl, 
For we will be jolly, and drown melancholy, 

With a health to each jovial and true-hearted soul."

THE STORMY WINDS DO BLOW. 

The following song I also found in Mr. Chappell's book. 
It is one of Charles Sloman's (1840) : 

' One Friday morn when we set sail, 

Not very far from land, 
We there did espy a fair pretty maid 

With a comb and a glass in her hand, her hand, her 

hand, 
With a comb and a glass in her hand. 

While the raging seas did roar, 

And the stormy winds did blow, 

While we jolly sailor-boys were up unto the top, 

And the land-lubbers lying down below, below, 

below, 
And the land-lubbers lying down below. 

Then up starts the capt'n of our gallant ship, 

And a brave young man was he ; 
( I've a wife and child in fair Bristol town, 

But a widow I fear she will be.' 
For the raging seas, &c. 



Music OF THE WATERS.

Then up starts the mate of our gallant ship, 

And a bold young man was he ; 
1 Oh, I have a wife in fair Portsmouth town, 

But a widow I fear she will be/ 

For the raging seas, &c. 
Then up starts the cook of our gallant ship, 

And a gruff old soul was he ; 
' Oh, I have a wife in Plymouth town, 

But a widow I fear she will be.' 

For the raging seas, &c. 
And then up spoke the little cabin-boy, 

And a pretty little boy was he ; 
' Oh, I am more grieved for my daddy and my mammy, 

Than you for your wives all three.' 

For the raging seas, &c. 
Then three times round went our gallant ship, 

And three times round went she ; 
For the want of a life-boat they all went down, 

And she sank to the bottom of the sea. 

Chorus. 

For the raging seas did roar, 
And the stormy winds did blow, 
While we jolly sailor-boys were up unto the top, 
And the land-lubbers lying down below, below, 
below." 

Right jovially r , and moderately fast.

Music OF THE WATERS. 







Something in it commends this song to the sailors 
of to-day ; the sentiment, it may be, is somewhat after the 
fashion of that expressed by some of their chanties, and 
it has a good swing about it. Whatever it is, however, 
it is frequently to be heard amongst forecastle assemblies. 

In Mr. Christie's collection of "Traditional Ballad Airs " 
(" Traditional Ballad Airs, from copies procured in the 
counties of Aberdeen, Banff, and Moray," by W. Christie, 
M.A., and the late Wm. Christie ; 2 vols.), I found a song 
called " Sailing in the Lowlands, Low " : 

" There was a good ship from the North countrie, 
And that ship's name was the Golden Vanitee ; 
Sailing low in the Lowlands, low in the sea, 
Sailing low in the Lowlands, low." 

The story is that of the cabin-boy boring two holes with 
an auger in the Spanish galleon, an heroic feat which he 
had been promised should be rewarded by the master of 
the Golden Vanitee, with gold, and his eldest daughter's 
hand ; the crew of the sinking Spanish ship fire on the boy 
as he swims towards his own, and his cruel master refuses 
to take him on board again. 

" < I will not take you up, boy,' the master he replied, 
'Though you sink in the Lowlands, low. 
I will not take you up, boy,' his cruel master cried ; 
* I will kill you, if you come on deck, and throw you down 

the tide, 

I will sink you in the Lowlands, low in the sea, 
I will sink you in the Lowlands, low." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



67 



(The boy's strength then fails him, and he is taken on 
board by his comrades, but only to die.) 

" His messmates took him up, but on the deck he died, 
Jt was in the Lowlands, low. 

Then they took the little boy, and sewed him in a hide, 
And they threw him overboard to go down with the tide, 
And he sank in the Lowlands, low in the sea, 
And he sank in the Lowlands, low." 

This song is a type of the nautical ones now so much in 
vogue in concert-halls and drawing-rooms, and of which 
Mr. Stephen Adams may be said to be the pioneer. The 
reason I have mentioned it here is, that I feel almost certain 
that it suggested the sailors' favourite chanty, " Lowlands," 
or the chanty suggested the song. Not knowing the date 
of the song in Mr. Christie's collection, I can only suppose 
that one of these surmises is correct, and I should be 
inclined to give the preference to the latter. I may add 
that the tunes are in no way alike. 

Amongst the numbers denoted as sailors' songs in the 
index to Mr. Chappell's volumes are the three following : 
" We be Three Poor Mariners/' an old sea-song of Charles 
Sloman's; "Britons, Strike Home," which, however, must not 
be confounded with Purcell's, and " The Spanish Armada." 

THE SPANISH ARMADA. 







" In eighty-eight, ere I was born, as I can well remember, 
In August was a fleet prepar'd, the month before 
September. 



F 2 



68 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



Spain, with Biscay and Portugal, Toledo and Grenada, 
All these did meet, and made a fleet, 
And call'd it the Armada." 

There are, of course, many verses to this somewhat 
Hibernian ditty, and, like all the songs in the admirable 
work from which I have quoted, it is to be found there 
harmonized. There are, I believe, two versions, of the 
next song. 

WE BE THREE POOR MARINERS. 
" We be three poor mariners, we be three poor mariners, 
Newly come from the seas, 
While others live at ease. 

Shall we go dance the round, the round, the round, 
Shall we go dance the round, the round, the round. 
And he that is a bully (jolly) boy 
Come pledge me on this ground, a ground, a ground. 

We care not for those martial men 

That do our states disdain, 
But we care for the merchantmen 

Who do our states maintain. 
To them we dance this round, around, around, 
To them we dance this round, around, around. 
And he that is a bully boy 
Come pledge me on this ground, a ground, a ground." 

* We be Three Poor Mariners " is still popular as a fore- 
castle song, and a glance at it satisfied me that it was a 
genuine tar's production.

70 MUSJC OF THE WATERS. 

Listen to my Ditty ; " " The British Sailors' Lament," sung 
to the tune of "Hark to Winchester;" Dr. Boyce's 
famous " Hearts of Oak," with David Garrick's fine words. 
Many others have been set by seamen to this grand melody ; 
one is known as " The Keppel's Triumph," commencing 

" Bear a hand, jolly tars, for bold Keppel appears, 
In spite of each charge from Sir Hugh Palliser." 

Another is "The Hardy Tars of Old England," or "The 
True Hearts of Oak": 

" Come, cheer up, my lads, let us haste to the Main, 
And rub out old scores with the dollars of Spain." 

TO ALL YOU LADIES NOW AT LAND. 
(Written at sea, by the late Earl of Dorset, in the first 
Dutch War.) 

" To all you ladies now at land, 

We men at sea indite ; 
But first would have you understand 

How hard it is to write ; 
The Muses now, and Neptune too, 
We must implore to write to you. 
With a fa la, la, la, la." 

There are eleven stanzas to this song, and, if history 
speaks the truth, it was written the night before the naval 
engagement in which Opdam, the Dutch admiral, was 
blown up, with all his crew. The circumstance of such a 
lively, easy-flowing song having been written on board 
ship, on the eve of an engagement, was justly held to be 
a fine instance of courage and gallantry.

72 Music OF THE WATERS. 



This song was noted down for me by the steward of the 
Dreadnought Hospital for Seamen, at Greenwich, who per- 
suaded the one remaining pensioner to sing it. The old 
fellow was upwards of ninety, and almost stone deaf, so 
attempting any vocalization at all was, to say the least of 
it, courageous on his part. He is known as " Daddy." This 
white-haired old hero, who had been in many perils 
and braved much danger in his day, now sits calmly 
talking it all over, and waiting for the end, in the noble 
home for old manners at Greenwich. We had some 
difficulty in explaining to him why I wanted him to sing 
me something he had known in his younger days, but 
when he did understand he seemed greatly interested, 
and assured me over and over again what a fine set of 
men sailors were, and how well worthy of any com- 
memoration,, for he added, " They've done, something for 
England, and England hasn't always done much for 
them." Then he went on to speak of some of the stirring 
scenes he had taken an active part in, and his face lighted 
up as he told of them, and the poor old man became 
quite animated, almost shouting in his eagerness to ex- 
plain some act of heroism, and trembling with anger at 
some remembered cowardice. When I left, old Daddy 
shook me warmly by the hand, and asked me to let him 
see my book when it was ready ; of course, I promised 
him I would, but I thought how improbable it was that 
those nearly sightless eyes would still be gazing on this 
world when " The Music of the Waters " was ready for 
publication. 

By the kind permission of Captain Algernon Drum- 
mond, composer of the music, and his co-author of the 
words, I am able to quote a very charming and favourite 
boat-song. It is known as " The Eton Boat-Song," 
and is much in vogue with the habitues of that place. 
"In tempo di Barcarola" is indicated at the beginning 
of the music, and " in tempo di Barcarola " it most 
certainly is.

There are many verses to this song, but I think four of 
them will be sufficient to show the style of it :

Rugby may make more row ; 
But we'll row, row for ever, 

Steady from stroke to bow. . . .

We may be slow on the feather, 

And seem to the boys old fools. . . . 
But we'll still swing together, 

And swear by the best of schools ; 
But we'll still swing together, 

And swear by the best of schools." 

THE BALLAD OF JOHN DORY. 

I found the words and tune of "John Dory" in 
" Hawkins's History of Music." The ballad runs as follows : 

" As it fell on a holiday, 
And upon a holy-tide, 
As it fell on a holiday, 
And upon a holy-tide, 
John Dory bought him an ambling nag 
To Paris for to ride a. 

And when John Dory to Paris was come, 

A little before the gate a ; 
John Dory was fitted, the porter was witted, 

To let him in thereat a.

The first man that John Dory did meet, 

Was good King John of France a ! 
John Dory conn'd well of his courtesie, 

But fell down in a trance a. 
A pardon, a pardon, my liege and my king ; 

For my merry men and for me a ; 
And all the churles in merrie England, 

I'll bring them all bound to thee a. 
Sir Nichol was then a Cornish man, 

A little beside Boligde a ; 
And he mann'd forth a good blacke barke, 

With fiftie good oares on a side a. 

Run up, my boy, unto the main-top, 
And looke what thou canst spie a ; 

Who, oh ! a goodly ship I do see, 
I trow it be John Dory a. 

They hoist their sailes both top and top, 

The mizen and all was tride a ; 
And every man stood to his lot, 

Whatever should betide a. 

The roaring canons then were plide, 

And dub a dub went the drumme a ; 
The braying trumpets loudly cride, 

To 'courage both all and some a. 
The grappling hooks were brought at length, 

The browne bill and the sword a ; 
John Dory at length, for all his strength, 

Was clapt fast under board a."

Music OF THE WATERS. 



HEY, BOYS, UP GO WE. 

This is an old English sea-song known as " Hey, boys, 
up go we " : 



H fr-^Fl 

^TJ *-.^=\ 




I have had so many kind offers of original sea-songs, 
and verses for my collection, that I feel a word of thanks 
is due to those who have made them. I am sure I shall 
be readily understood, when I say that I have had 
to confine myself solely to the sailors and seamen 
generally, as poets and composers. I cannot refrain, how- 
ever, from quoting a verse entitled " The Sailor Boy," 
from a poem by a lady of title : 

" Sometimes in dreams I see him 

Where the sweet spice islands rise, 
And storms are hushed for ever 

In the deep unclouded skies ; 
I see my poor wrecked Willie 

Stand alone upon the main, 
Pining, praying for a friendly ship, 

To bear him home again." 

This most absurd song was given as a specimen of those 
written by incompetent describers of sailor-life ; in a very 
amusing article in one of Tinsley's Magazines, the writer 
marvels not a little at the total suppression of storms in the 
Spice Islands ; but is simply " lost in wonder at the amazing 
feat performed by Willie of standing alone upon the main." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 77 

As Willie's ship is supposed to have gone to the .bottom, 
he cannot be imagined as standing on the main-deck, and 
it therefore only remains for us to picture this most 
heroic young gentleman in an upright position on the 
open sea. 

This will serve to give some idea of the ridiculous plight 
poets and poetesses find themselves in when they attempt, 
without having any knowledge of nautical terms/to write 
songs for sailors. Jack must be his own poet, his own 
composer, and his own compiler, if we are to have good, 
genuine specimens of them. " It must be admitted that, 
in spite of the simplicity and purity of character ascribed 
to the sailor by novelists, not a few of the songs which he 
sang were highly objectionable on the score of morality. 
They were, however, no worse in this respect than the songs 
which one occasionally hears in the smoking-car of an 
excursion train, and were decidedly better than certain 
opera-bouffe songs. 

****** 

" But both the good and the bad ceased when the sailor 
disappeared, and to revive them on the deck of an iron 
steamship would be as impossible as to bring back the 
Roman trireme." (Extract from Harper's Magazine ', 
July, 1882.) 

As I write these few closing remarks on the songs and 
chanties of English and American sailors, a somewhat 
curious instance of Jack's musical ideas comes before me in 
the columns of one of the daily papers. "A piano-organ 
had just commenced to fill the street with the sounds of a 
hornpipe when a man having the appearance of a sailor 
passed along, and was at once attracted by the music. He 
then proceeded to the spot, and commenced to dance to 
the music. His dancing was neat and finished, and he was 
soon the centre of an admiring crowd. After a fair turn 
he gave the woman in charge of the machine a few coppers, 
and she continued with the hornpipe. He danced again, and 
was watched by an ever-growing crowd. The man at the 



78 Music OF THE WATERS. 

handle turned the barrel, and a waltz was next played. 
' Jack/ for such he was, was equally at home with the waltz, 
but when a gavotte was played his terpsichorean antics were 
brought to a sudden close. In vain he tried to keep time to 
the air ; but after giving a few more coppers to the woman, 
he was suited with a schottische. The climax was, however, 
reached when the ' Marseillaise' was ground out. ' Jack ' 
brought himself to a standstill, and after making sure of the 
tune, he beat a hasty retreat, amid the mingled laughter and 
regret of the onlookers." In spite of the assertion that sing- 
ing and steam are irreconcilable, and that the chanty-man 
has passed away, I yet contend that the modern sailor 
knows much more of music than is generally believed. 
Jack's whole life and soul seem to be in his legs when a horn- 
pipe is played, whether at sea or on shore, and he is not 
more likely to attempt a jig to a martial air, or a waltz to 
the time of a gavotte, than a popular prima-donna would be 
to sing an aria in the wrong key.

IN my small collection of Russian sailors' songs, I have in-

crushing the grain on the wharf, previous to loading the 
vessels with it. The same custom appears to have existed 
in the Hebrides ; short, plaintive, Gaelic chants called 
" Luinigs " were used. The men had what were knbwn as

82 Music OF THE WATERS. 

" Jorrams " or rowing songs, to which they kept time with 
their oars. These "Luinigs" and "Jorrams" differ from 
the Highland music in being adapted to the harp, on which 
a chord was doubtless struck from time to time to serve as 
a rudimentary accompaniment, and after the harp fell into 
disuse the Luinigs gradually died out. A very character- 
istic sample of the style of one of these old " Jorrams/' or 
rowing songs, is to be found in Sir Walter Scott's " Lady 
of the Lake." The song " Hail to the Chief," which is 
sung by the clansmen in honour of Roderick Vich Alpine, 
is an imitation of the Jorrams or boat-songs of the High- 
landers, which were usually composed in honour of their 
chief. They are so adapted as to keep time with the sweep 
of the oars, and it is easy to distinguish between those in- 
tended to be sung to the oars of a galley, where the stroke 
is lengthened and doubled as it were, and those which were 
timed to the rowers of an ordinary boat. 

" Row, vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands, 

Stretch to your oars, for the evergreen pine. 
O' ! that the rosebud that graces yon islands, 
Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine ! 
O that some seedling gem, 
Worthy such noble stem, 

Honoured and blessed in their shadow might grow. 
Loud should Clan-Alpine then 
Ring from his deepmost glen, 
Roderigh Vich Alpine Dhu, ho ! ieroe ! " 

" In Gaelic music all is modal. The words occupy the first 
place, words and music implicitly following the idiosyn- 
crasies of the Gaelic language. 

" In Gaelic there is no such thing as the last syllable of 
one line being in rhyme with the last syllable of the next, 
the rhyme being not on the syllable, but on the vowel sound." 

The foregoing remarks, although in no wise applicable 
to water-songs in particular, I have nevertheless thought 
advisable to quote from Professor Colin Brown's (Anderson's 



Music OF THE WATERS. 83 

College, Glasgow) introduction to the " Killin Collection 
of Gaelic Songs (with music and translations, by Charles 
Stewart, Tighn-Duin, Killin)," before giving the very few 
specimens of genuine Gaelic boat-songs, which, in spite of 
every endeavour, I have alone been enabled to collect. 

" The gallant seaman has a somewhat light reputation in 
Gaelic poetry, more perhaps from his wandering life than 
any inconsistency peculiar to his profession. It is impossible 
to conceive that an open, honest, sterling character, like the 
British seaman, could be inconstant in love ; but if a heart- 
less fickleness is really his character, it is not to be wondered 
at that a simple, honest-hearted lassie will not believe so. 
Be that as it may, however, he has ever been the object of 
ardent love and enduring constancy with the warm-hearted 
Highland maiden. 

" ' Fear a Bhata ' (literally ' Boatman/ the usual title of a 
man sailing his own ship in the Highlands) is the title of 
one of the Gaelic songs, remarkable both for its extreme 
beauty of sentiment and imagery. Although the Duanagan 
or lilts are generally of a light, hilarious character, they 
are not all so, and ' Fear a Bhata' is one of the excep- 
tions." The verses and tune of this water-song whicl 
follow, together with these quotations on the subject, I 
owe to Mr. Donald Campbell, late Lieutenant of the 
57th Regiment, author of the valuable treatise 1 "The 
Language, Poetry, and Music of the Highland Clans." 



" FEAR A BHATA " (THE BOATMAN). 

(" Fear a Bhata " is pronounced " ear a vata." " Na horo 
eile " is merely a call used by the boatmen.) 

i. " How often hunting the highest hill-top, 

I scan the ocean thy sail to see ; 
Wilt come to night, love ? Wilt come to-morrow ? 
Wilt ever come, love, to comfort me ? 

1 Published by D. R. Collie and Son, 19, St. David Street, Edin- 
burgh.

84 Music OF THE WATERS. 

Fear a Bhata, na horo eile, 
Fear a Bhata, na horo eile, 
Fear a Bhata, na horo eile, 
O fare thee well, love, where'er thou goest ." 

2. " They call thee fickle, they call thee false one, 

And seek to change me, but all in vain, 
No, thou'rt my dream yet throughout the dark night, 
And every morn yet I watch the main. 
Fear a Bhata, &c." 

3. " There's not a hamlet too well I know it 

Where you go wandering or stay awhile, 
But all its old folk you win with talking, 

And charm its maidens with song and smile. 
Dost thou remember the promise made me, 

The tartan plaidie, the silken gown, 
The ring of gold, with thy hair and portrait ? 
That gown and ring I will never own. 
Fear a Bhata, na horo eile, 
Fear a Bhata, na horo eile, 
Fear a Bhata, na horo eile, 
O fare thee well, love, where'er thou goest." 

" Fear a Bhata " is sometimes written " Fhir a Bhata." 
I have not given the Gaelic version of this song, for I 
am doubtful if many are sufficiently versed in the lan- 
guage of Ossian to render its insertion necessary, and 
the English version so admirably sets forth the pathos 
of this truly Highland gem, that I feel no hesitation 
in suppressing it. The third verse, and especially the 
lines 

" But all its old folk you win with talking, 
And charm its maidens with song and smile " 

is charming, and one of the most poetic of compliments to 
sailors.

MOCH'S MI G EIRDLE SA MHADUINN. 

From Lieutenant Campbell's work I . also quote the 
following boat-song. It is known as " Moch's mi g Eirdle 
sa Mhaduinn." I give one verse in Gaelic : 

Gaelic. 

i. " Moch's mi g eirdle sa Mhaduinn, 
Moch's mi g eirdle sa Mhaduinn, 
'Strom enslainteach m'aigne, 

'O nach t'eibhiad mi'n caidreamh nam braithrean, 
'O nach t'eibh iad mi'n caidreamh nam braithrean." 

English Version. 

i. " On rising in the morning, 

Heavy and sorrowful was my mind, 

Since they did not call me to the fellowship of the 

brethren, 
Since they did not call me to the fellowship of the 

brethren." 



86 Music OF THE WATERS. 

2. "Too short has been the time I remained on my visit 

to James, 1 

From whom I parted yesterday, 
On the morning of Easter Sunday. 
From whom, &c." 

" May God guide the helm of the oak, 
That sailed on the sea, 
Before it began to ebb, 
Before, &c." 

" Although it had been seed-time, 
I would not have returned from thee ; 
I should sit in the bow of thy boat, 
I should, &c." 

11 When the rest would be in action, 
My employment would be a pastime, 
Drinking bumpers of wine in the cabin, 
Drinking, &c." 

(I quite agree with him, " the employment " would be so 
light that the office must have been a perfect sinecure.) 

" The Dew-cuoydertach, swarthy, 
Broad, high-shouldered, tight, 
With many spears and iron blades in her bosom, 
With, &c." 

" It is not the rider of steeds 
That would gain the racing bet of thee, 
When thou spreadest thy kerch-white* sails over the 

sea, 
When, &c." 

1 The Highland chief was always addressed by his Christian name 
by his own clansmen. 

2 Kerch-white. The head-dress of the Highland females was 
called "Creid," a kerchief. Being snowy-white, the creid is often 
used as a simile for snowy-whiteness. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 87 



" When high are the bellying sails, 
Over the ridges of the proud ocean, 
And numerous waves are spouting beneath the keel, 
And numerous, &c." 

" Great is my love to thee, 
Though I will not make a display of it, 
Son of the man with whom the Brealseans would rise 

in arms, 
Son of, &c." 

" Beloved of the women of Loch Treig 
And Strath Ossian of pleasant meadows, 
Who have badgers and deer in their pantries, 
Who, &c." 

" A band would arise with thee from Troy, 
With the bent yew on their shoulders, 
And from the cold hills of Caruna, lairge ; 
And from, &c." 

" Another tribe of the Clan, 
The clan Tain from Mnin (the anvil), 
They are the men that would go into the conflict 

fearlessly, 
Who go into the conflict fearlessly." 

" Many a youthful hero, 
With the quiver behind his shield, 
Will come to thee from the wings of Mel-Na-larig, 
Will, &c." 

" That would answer thy call ; 
Without fear, without ailment, 

When thou raisest the fiery cross for deeds illustrious, 
When, &c." 

Doubtless many of the peculiarities of this song, of which 
there are a variety, will be known to students of Ossian. 
For the general reading public, I am unable to offer any

solution of such lines as " With the bent yew on their 
shoulders," or the last line of the first verse " Since they 
did not call me to the fellowship of the brethren." 
Probably, both these lines allude to some Gaelic custom. 
The tune follows : 




OCH NAN OCH, MO LEIR CHRADH. 

" Och Nan och, Mo leir Chradh," or " Oh, my painful 
Sorrow," is another boatman's favourite, and treats of a 
bold and adventurous seaman, Jain Garble MacGille 
Challum of Vlathsay, who was lost on Hesgair.

By kind permission I am enabled to quote the follow- 
ing song from the collection entitled " Songs of the 
North," jointly edited by Annie Macleod and Harold 
Boulton, music arranged by Malcolm Lawson, and pub- 
lished by Messrs. Field and Tuer, of the Leadenhall 
Press, London. The " Skye Boat - Song " (Jacobite) 
illustrates an episode in the wanderings of Prince 
Charlie in the winter of 1745-6, when he made his 
escape from the net his enemies had spread for him, by 
putting out to sea with Flora Macdonald and a few 
devoted Highland boatmen in a rising storm, an example 
which his pursuers, though well provided with boats, did 
not venture to imitate. The chorus begins the song and 
comes in at the end of each verse. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



91 



Chorus. 

" Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing, 

Onward, the sailors cry, 
Carry the lad that's born to be king, 
Over the sea to Skye." 

1. " Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar, 

Thunder-clouds rend the air ; 
Baffled, our foes stand by the shore ; 
Follow, they will not dare. 
Speed, bonnie boat, &c." 

2. " Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep ; 

Ocean's a royal bed ; 
Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep 
Watch by your weary head. 
Speed, bonnie boat, &c." 

There are two more verses given by Mr. Boulton, and 
the Gaelic version is also to be found ; indeed, this is the 
case with nearly all the songs in this most charming of 
Scottish song-books. As my collection of Scotch water- 
songs is so very limited I feel the more grateful to the 
publishers for their kindness and courtesy in allowing me to 
make use of the " Skye Boat-Song : "

92 Music OF THE WATERS. 

To the following words I have not been able to find any 
recognized tune ; it is known as the boat-song of " Domhnul 
Ruadh Gaolach," and in Mr. Campbell's book (" Language, 
Poetry, and Music of the Highland Clans "), he gives a very 
graphic description of the song being sung to him by an 
old seaman, when he was quite a boy. He says, " When 
sung by the old seaman, the listener could not help fancy- 
ing that he heard a voice slowly rising from behind a sea, 
until it attained the crest of a mountain billow, and burst on 
his ear in a regular bravura of seamanlike exultation ; it 
then gradually receded and sunk, until he felt apprehensive 
that the singer was struggling with the capricious waves, 
then, after a seeming silence and to his great relief, it 
began to grow perceptibly on his ear, until the exulting 
chorus burst upon him afresh, in a gush of melody that 
made his heart swell in sympathy with the triumphant 
pluck and stamina of the strong-armed rowers ; the whole 
crew were supposed to join in thzfonu or chorus." 

DOMHNUL RUADH GAOLACH. 

" Donald, red-haired and beloved, 

Horiu ova, ro huvo, 
Who standest firmly by an oak helm, 

Horiu eyle', ova hi, 
Hi 'ri oyri, nan hi ri'u. 

" Who standest firmly by an oak helm, 

Horiu ova, ro huvo ; 
Wild is the course of thy boat, 

Horiu eyle', ova hi, 
Hi J ri oyri, nan hi ri'u. 

" Wild is the course of thy boat, 

Horiu ova, ro huvo, 
Cleaving the roaring sea, 

Horiu eyle', ova hi, 
Hi Vi oyri, nan hi ri'u. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 93 

" Cleaving the roaring sea, 
Horiu ova, ro huvo, 
Keep a sharp eye on the sea-rock Baru. 

Horiu eyle 7 , ova hi, 
Hi 'ri oyri, nan h ri'u. 

" Keep a sharp eye on the sea-rock Baru, 

Horiu ova, ro huvo, 
Sail on the crest of the phosphoric waves, 

Horiu eyle', ova hi, 
Hi 'ri oyri, nan hi ri'u." 

This song is descriptive of an expedition of loyal High- 
landers on their way from the Isle of Skye to join the 
army of Montrose. The first line .is in itself a curiosity ; 
why should the first adjective applied to Donald qualify 
the second ? " Donald, red-haired and as a natural 
sequence beloved ;" "and yet beloved "would have seemed 
the more likely rendering of the Gaelic sentence ; at least, 
had I been the translator, I should have adopted it. 

William Black's delightful novels, so descriptive of the 
sea-life of the far west of Scotland, have doubtless rendered 
many of us familiar with snatches of Gaelic song, and the 
following, which he mentions in his Yachting Romance, 
" White Wings," is to be found in its entirety in the Killin 
collection before mentioned. 

HO, RO ! CLANSMEN. 

" Cheerily, and all together ! 

Ho, ro, Clansmen ! 
A long, strong pull together ! 

Ho, ro, Clansmen ! 
Soon the flowing breeze will blow, 
Will blow the snowy canvas on her. 

Ho, ro, Clansmen ! 
A long, strong pull together, 

Ho, ro, Clansmen ! 



94 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



Wafted by the breeze of morn 
We'll quaff the joyous horn together. 

Ho, ro, Clansmen ! " 

Another chorus Mr. Black mentions in the same 
book was given in Gaelic by the men, the refrain he says 
was : 

" O boatman, a farewell to you, 
O boatman, a farewell to you, 
Wherever you may be going."

LOVE BOAT SONG. 

The following " Jorram " or " Love Boat Song," is given 
in the Killin collection, and is of course, like the other 
melodies in it, harmonized. I merely give the air and the 
last verses and chorus ; the first seem to be much more 
suitable for landsmen than boatmen in their sentiments. 
The latter verses are essentially those of a water-song, and 
have some touch of the true Hebridean labour rhythm in 
them :

In an old collection of Scotch ballads and songs ("Ancient 
Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland," hitherto un- 
published, by Peter Buchan, 1828) I found the ballad of 



96 Music OF THE WATERS, 

Sir Patrick Spens. I am told, on good authority, that it 
used to be a great favourite with Scotch seamen, and was 
often sung by the fishermen of some parts of Scotland. 
The number of verses contained in this ballad makes it 
impossible for me to quote it at length ; I merely give 
the first to show the style of the composition, which is 
doubtless familiar to many. 

" The king sits in Dunfermline town, 

A-drinking at the wine ; 
Says, * Where will I get a good skipper 
Will sail the saut seas fine ? ' " 

Reading in a Glasgow paper one day an account of a 
lecture delivered by Professor Blackie on Scottish songs, 
I was attracted by some remarks he made on the scarcity 
of sea-songs amongst them, a statement that scarcely 
coincides with one made some time before by a writer in 
The Illustrated London Neivs. The writer, after speaking 
of sailor-songs in general, says : " In speaking of these 
songs of the sea have I ever, by any chance, used the word 
' English ' ? If so, I tremble and retract. The brawny 
Scot who stands out for ' British ' to be applied as the only 
allowable term, in cases when it is obviously impossible to 
say 'Scottish' (as in speaking, for example, of Shakespeare); 
this stern patriot would be even more in the right than 
usual in this particular case. Nearly all of the very best of 
British sea-songs have been written by Scotchmen. There 
was Campbell, without a rival in any age, whose chants 
no Tyrtseus can ever equal, as no battle-field can have the 
poetry of the surging wave. There was Allan Cunning- 
ham, of The Wet Sheet and the Flowing Sea;' and there 
was Thomson, of the ' Seasons ' not that the ' Seasons ' 
can fairly be described as nautical, but that few people 
realize that he wrote anything besides that unforgotten 
and unread poem while fewer associate him with ' Rule 
Britannia,' to which magnificent melody he wrote the

splendid and spirited words. Another tune that every- 
body knows, while but few South-countrymen have ever 
heard the beautiful words, * braid Scots ;' this, it must be 
owned, is Mickle's ' There is nae Luck aboot the Hoose.' 
Yet I think no other poem in the world gives like this one 
the excitement, and the passion, and the half-humorous 
bustle of the sailor's return, nor so brings before one the 
life of the little seaport town. Burns called it ' one of the 
most beautiful songs in the Scots' or any other language,' 
and Burns himself might have written the cry, twice 
repeated, 

" ' And will I see his face again ? 
And will I hear him speak? 
I'm downright dizzy wi' the thought ; 
In troth I'm like to greet ! ' 

and the writer might have added the last verse found in 
the manuscript of William Julius Mickle's 

" ' If Colin's weel, and weel content, 

I hae nae mair to crave, 
And gin I live to mak' him sae, 
I'm blest aboon the lave.' 

The pith of the whole story, to my mind, lies in these four 
unpublished lines. Why they were suppressed I know not, 
but it seems to me that the self-renunciation of the mariner's 
wife should have been given to the world along with the 
other verses of the poem." 

The writer of these remarks, should my book ever fall 
into his hands, must pardon me if I contradict him, and 
seemingly attempt to pour cold water on his eulogistic 
summary of Scottish sailor-songs, with all due appreciation 
of Cunningham's beautiful 

" A wet sheet and a flowing sea, 
A wind that follows fast, 

H

And fills the white and rustling sail, 
And bends the gallant mast ! " 

and Mickle's " Mariner's Wife." I must own that, compared 
with our one great master's songs of the sea, these are but 
sea-songs written for landsmen. There has never been but 
one man's songs, written on shore, popular with the blue- 
jackets ; but one man's songs that seafaring men have 
declared redolent of pitch and tar and oakum, written with 
the true spirit of a sailor ; but one man's songs that the 
ship's fiddlers scraped on Saturday nights at sea before 
the toast of " Sweethearts and Wives/' or were sung to 
cheer the tars as they toiled at the capstan and that man 
was Dibdin. His songs sent many a strapping young 
fellow straight from the Sans-Souci Theatre, where they 
first heard them, to the Tower Hill to join the navy ; indeed, 
they became at one time a cheap substitute for the press- 
gang. He painted the British seaman as he found him, 
and made him neither better nor worse than he was. He 
drank much grog, he swore profusely, but he fought like a 
lion, and he won the First of June, and the Nile, and Tra- 
falgar. And in return for this true portrait of themselves, 
the sailors paid Dibdin the compliment of singing his 
songs as they did their own chanties, at their work on 
board. 

To return to Professor Blackie's lecture, one of the sea- 
songs, or, to speak more correctly, songs of the sea, that 
he mentioned was Lady Nairne's Caller Herrin\ 1 which, 
he added, to be properly appreciated should be heard sung 
by a Newhaven fish-wife. There is a genuine sea-sadness 
and at the same time healthy stimulus in this most beau- 
tiful song, and the " Flower of Strathearne," as its gifted 
authoress used to be called in the days when she was Miss 

1 It is said that the melody of " Caller Herrin' " was first suggested 
by the fish-wives' calls through the streets of Edinburgh, and the bells 
of St. Giles' chiming at the same time. It is a pretty tradition and 
one that is quite in keeping with the style of the song.

Oliphant of Gask, must have learnt some of the sea-toilers' 
suffering even in her sheltered home on the brae above the 
lovely, placid Earne, when she wrote 

" When ye were sleeping on your pillows, 
Dreamt ye aught o' our puir fellows, 
Darkling as they face the billows, 
A' to fill our woven willows. 
Buy my caller herrin', 
They're bonnie fish and halesome farin'. 
Buy my caller herrin', 
New drawn frae the Forth. 
Wha'll buy my caller herrin' ? 
They're no brought here without brave darin', 
Buy my caller herrin', ye little ken their worth ! 
Wha'll buy my caller herrin' ? 
O, ye may ca' them vulgar farin' 
Wives and mithers maist despairin', 
Ca' them lives o' men."

and " The Boatie Rows/' there is not another water-song 
amongst the ordinary editions of Scotch Melodies, whereas 
in similar editions of English Standard Songs, a very large 
proportion are of a nautical nature, though certainly not 
sufficiently so to please sailor-men. They may seem to us 
all that can be desired in the way of " go " and salt-like 
vigour. We may feel that the " Arethusa," the " Bay of 
Biscay/' or <c Hearts of Oak," surpass themselves in their 
heartiness and national pride, and so they do, and when we 
hear them we are carried away by them, and think what is 
there in the world to equal them. Well, the sailor evi- 
dently does not agree with us. I remember an old " salt " 
once saying to me that "The Bay of Biscay" was a good 
song in its way, but not to be compared to " Blow the 
Man down." I wished to humour the speaker, and for- 
more reasons than one to keep him in tune, so I did not 
contradict him, but merely changed the subject, and mar- 
velled not a little at the strangeness of taste that could 
find so much inspiration in a tune associated with such 
words as 

" Give me some time to blow the man down ! " 

and fail to see the grandeur in Davy's song. 

I am afraid Mr. Stephen Adams will scarcely thank me 
if I narrate some of the encomiums I have heard passed 
upon his favourite drawing-room sea-songs. " Nancy Lee " 
is admitted to be somewhat of the right sort, but "Jack's 
Yarn " they look upon with very mixed feelings ; the com- 
poser has, however, many admirers and singers of his songs 
in the young gentlemen in swallow-tailed coats, who delight 
after-dinner audiences with their yearnings to become bold 
buccaneers, and can afford to dispense with the approval of 
the blue-jackets. 

Speaking of Scotch songs, there is an old song attributed 
to Dunbar of a very plaintive character, used when heaving 
the anchor. The tune is the same as that of " Old Storm- 
along" : 



Music OF THE WATERS. 101 

" My feeding was once o' the best corn and hay 
That ever grew in corn-field or meadow sae gay ; 
But noo I'm turned out at the back o' a dyke, 
To keep the blackbirds company on a cauld winter nicht. 
I'm a puir auld horse. 

Dunbar is responsible for the following ; it was very 
popular amongst the fishermen there, and I believe was 
sung to the well-known tune of " There is nae Luck aboot 
the Hoose":- 

A CRAB SONG. 

" Come, Sandy, man, 
An 5 bear a han', 
Rax doon anither oar, 
There's creels to bait, 
An' creels to set, 
An' crabs to bring ashore. 

For crabs are east, 

An' crabs are west, 

An' crabs are in the bay ; 

There's fifty dizzen at the least 

In a' the creels the day. 

" Fling in the tow, 
Steer aff her bow 
An' get the boat to sea ; 
There's crabs galore 
To bring ashore, 
Just waitin' you an' me. 
For crabs are east, &c. 

" To glunch and gloom, 
An' sook yer thoom, 
Will no buy Jenny's tea, 
Nor put a frock 
On little Jock ; 
Then let us get to sea, 
For crabs are east, &c. 



102 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



" Let ithers try 
F'or fish to fry, 
At saxteen pence a score ; 
Our creels we'll get, 
Our creels we'll set, 
An' bring the crabs ashore. 

For crabs are meat 

An' crabs are drink 

To fisher-folk, we say, 

An' fifty dizzen at the least 

Are in the creels the day." 

There are many more verses, all with the same quaint 
refrain, but I think the sentiment is pretty well expressed 
in those I have given.

KEELMEN'S AND FISHERMEN'S SONGS, 

AND SONGS OF THE PRESS GANG 

ON TYNESIDE. 



" We islanders should love the sea, 
The fresh wind, coiled nets, ballast heap, 
The full brown sail, but as for me, 
Again within that harbour's lee, 
I let the sea-song go to sleep." 

WILLIAM BELL SCOTT. 



KEELMEN'S AND FISHERMEN'S SONGS, 

AND SONGS OF THE PRESS GANG 

ON TYNESIDE. 



"WEEL MAY THE KEEL ROW." 

THE local song of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, " The Keel 
Row," is intimately connected with Sandgate, the Wapping 
of Newcastle and the residence of the keelmen and sailors. 
It is truly the national anthem of the " Canny Toon," and 
never fails, when heard, to raise the soul of every Tyne- 
sider. 

There are many who dispute the Tynesider's claim to 
the song, attributing the origin of it to Glasgow. The 
Scotch version runs 

" As I was going thro' Cannongate." 

The Newcastle has it "Sandgate," the locale of the 
keelmen, and without doubt their original site. The 
introduction of steamboats, and the general use of staiths, 
by which the coals are conveyed direct from the waggon to 
the ship, have greatly reduced the number of keelmen in 
Newcastle. Sandgate is now chiefly occupied by the Irish. 
A keelman's hospital may still be seen there ; it was erected 
for the benefit of aged and infirm keelmen, and chiefly at 
their own cost : probably this is one of the few instances 



108 Music OF THE WATERS. 

of seafaring men's forethought, and it may also be said 
to be a monument to the poor raised by the poor. 

For a genuine description of keels and keelmen, their 
origin, degeneration, &c., I should recommend a perusal of 
Mr. Charleton's most interesting book, " Newcastle Town." 1 
There will be found a true account of these most quaint 
craft and quainter craftsmen, beginning with their lineal 
descent from the " Chiules " of the ancient Scandinavian 
rovers, in which, nearly five hundred years before Columbus 
saw America, the adventurous Norsemen crossed the 
Atlantic and visited Labrador, Newfoundland, and New 
England in which, in earlier times, they sailed to harass 
Ireland and Scotland, and in which, after the retire- 
ment of the Romans, they came to England and took 
possession of the country. " They were," he says, 
" wonderfully fine sailors, and a beautiful sight it was to 
see a fleet of keels manned by the Tyne keelmen the 
finest sailors and handlers of craft in England beating 
up-river against a head-wind." It is probable that the 
keel has sailed the waters of the Tyne ever since the 
Saxon invasion. 

WEEL MAY THE KEEL ROW. 

" As I cam thro' Sandgate, thro' Sandgate, thro' Sandgate, 
As I cam thro' Sandgate, I heard a lassie sing : 

Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row ; 
Weel may the keel row, that my laddie's in. 

Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row, 
Oh ! weel may the keel row, that my laddie's in. 

" He wears a blue bonnet, blue bonnet, blue bonnet, 
He wears a blue bonnet, a dimple in his chin ; 

Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row, 
Weel may the keel row, that my laddie's in. 

Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row ; 
Oh ! weel may the keel row, that my laddie's in." 

1 Walter Scott, Warwick Lane, London.

H : - 



The following, " Weel may the Keel Row, that gets the 
Bairns their Breed," is another old version of the Keel 
Row : 

44 Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row, 
Weel may the keel row, 
And better may she speed ; 

Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row, 
Weel may the keel row, 
That gets the bairns their breed.'' 

1. " We tuik wor keel up te the dyke, 

Up te the dyke, up te the dyke, 
We tuik wor keel up te the dyke, 
An' there we gat her load ; 
Then sailed away doon te Shields, 
Doon te Shields, doon te Shields, 
Then sailed away doon te Shields, 
And shipped wor coals aboard. 

Singin' Weel may the keel, &c. 

2. " Then we rowed away up te the fest, 

Up te the fest, up te the fest, 



110 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



We rowed away up te the fest 
Cheerly every man ; 
Pat by wor geer and moored wor keel, 
An' moored wor keel, an' moored wor keel, 
Pat by wor geer and moored wor keel, 
Then went an' drank wor can. 

Singin' Weel may the keel, &c. 

3. " Wor canny wives, wor clean fireside, 

Wor bonny bairns their parent's pride 
Sweet smiles that myek life smoothly glide, 
We find when we gan hyem ; 
They'll work for us when we get aud, 
They'll keep us frae the winter's caud, 
As life declines they'll us uphaud 
When young we uphaud them. 

Singin' Weel may the keel, &c." 

Unfortunately this roseate-hued picture of the keelman's 
domestic bliss is somewhat rudely dispelled by the song 
entitled, "The Sandgate Lass's Lament," which tells a 
slightly different tale. 

THE SANDGATE LASS'S LAMENT. 




" I was a young maiden truly, 
And lived in Sandgate Street ; 
I thought to marry a good man, 
To keep me warm and neat ; 



Music OF THE WATERS. Ill 

" Some good-like body, some bonny body, 
To be with me at noon ; 
But last I married a keelman, 
And my good days are done. 

" I thought to marry a parson, 
To hear me say my prayers 
But I have married a keelman, 
And he kicks me down the stairs. 

" I thought to marry a dyer, 
To dye my apron blue ; 
But I have married a keelman, 
And he makes me sairly rue. 

" I thought to marry a joiner, 
To make me chair and stool ; 
But I have married a keelman, 
And he's a perfect fool. 

" I thought to marry a sailor, 
To bring me sugar and tea ; 
But I have married a keelman, 
And that he lets me see." 

Many of the local songs of Northumberland are full of 
exquisite humour. Here is one well-known to North- 
umbrians in general and to Northumbrian fishermen and 
seamen in particular. It was mentioned amongst a few 
others in an article which I found in a very old volume of 
BlackwoocFs Magazine. The verses are given somewhat 
differently in the book of " Northumbrian Minstrelsy " 
(published by the Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle- 
upon-Tyne), and the tune that it is set to there is that 
which is known as " The Wedding o' Blythe ; or, Blue's gaen 
oot o' the Fashion " 

" Blue's gaen oot o' the fashion, 
Red's come in with the new ; 
But I'll have a sailor laddie, 
And dye my apron blue."

" O ! the lousy cutter,

They pressed him far away foreign 
Wi' Nelson ayont the salt sea. 

" They always come in the night, 
They never come in the day, 
They always come in the night, 
And steal the laddies away." 

" Captain Bover," which follows, was one of the most 
popular " press-gang " songs :

" The ballads and tunes illustrating the doings of the 
press-gang in the Newcastle district have deserved greater 
attention and more searching investigation from the lovers 
of historical knowledge than has hitherto been accorded 
them. 'Captain Bover' and the three following melodies 
are interesting memorials of these stirring times, and as 
expressions of the popular feeling towards this tyrannical

mode of appeal to the patriotism of the sailors. This 
oppressive mode of recruiting for the navy acted with great 
seventy upon the sailors, keelmen, and all others of the 
working population whose avocations partook in the least

and resulted in riot and bloodshed. The arrival of a vessel 
' On his Majesty's service ' in the Tyne was regarded 
with mingled feelings of aversion and fear by those who 
were liable to be called upon, and the press-gang was a 
fertile theme for local rhymsters from the earliest period of 
its operation down to living memory."

" Nae rnair we'll fish the Coolly Tyne " is the title of 
another of these quaint songs. I give the words : 

" Nae mair we'll fish the coolly Tyne, 

Nae mair the oozy Team, 
Nae mair we'll try the sedgy Pont, 

Or Derwent's woody stream ; 
But we'll away to Coquetside, 

For Coquet bangs them a', 
Whose winding streams sae sweetly glide, 

By Brinkburn's bonny Ha ! 

" At Weldon brigg there's wale o' wine, 

If ye hae coin in pocket ; 
If ye can thraw a heckle fine, 

There's wale o' trouts in Coquet. 
And we will quaff the red-blood wine, 

Till Weldon's wa's shall reel, 
We'll drink success to hook and line, 

And a' wha bear the creel. 

" And O ! in all their angling bouts, 

On Coquet, Tyne, or Reed, 
Whether for maidens or for trouts, 
May anglers still succeed. 

" By Till or Coquet, Tyne or Reed, 

In sunshine or in rain, 
May fisher ne'er put foot in stream, 

Or hand in purse in vain. 
Then luck be to the angler lads, 

Luck to the rod and line ; 
Wi' morn's first beam, we'll wade the stream, 

The night we'll wet with wine." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 121 

The River Coquet, according to the local anglers' songs, 
is superior to all the other Northumbrian rivers for its 
fishing. 

" Oh ! freshly from his mountain holds 

Comes down the rapid Tyne, 
But Coquet's still the stream of streams, 

So let her still be mine. 
" There's mony a sawmon lies in Tweed, 

And mony a trout in Till, 
But Coquet, Coquet aye for me, 
If I may hae my will. 

Another goes : 

" The Coquet for ever ! the Coquet for aye ! 
The Coquet, the king of the stream an' the brae, 
Frae his high mountain throne to his bed in the sea, 
Oh ! where shall you find such a river as he ? 
Oh ! where shall you find such a river as he ? 

" Then blessings be on him, and long may he glide, 
The fisherman's home and the fisherman's pride, 
Frae Harden's green hill to old Warkworth so grey, 
The Coquet for ever ! the Coquet for aye ! " 

The following is in favour of the Tyne : 

u Tyne river, running rough or smooth,

Chorus. " So here's to coaly Tyne, &c." 

There are a number of verses to this song, all more or 
less patriotic in sentiment ; but, like most local songs, it 
could only be interesting to those who are acquainted 
with the people and places alluded to. Tyneside is so rich 
in songs, that I find myself obliged to confine my selections 
to those that are best known as the favourites of the water- 
side population. 

The fisherfolk who belong to that most quaint north- 
country village, Cullercoats, have acquired for themselves 
a celebrity that is only rivalled by one or two other similar 
places. Their fresh vigorous hardihood, fearless boldness, 
and thrifty ways have long been characteristic of them, but 
it is perhaps to the Cullercoats fishwives that the fact of 
their wide-spread popularity is especially due, with their 
warm and at all times seasonable-looking costumes, their 
always fresh and comely and sometimes really bonny faces, 
and their creels of tempting fish; the Cullercoats fish- 
wives are familiar and welcome objects in the streets of 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and their oft- repeated cries of 
" Will ye buy any fish ? " and " Shares o' caller ling," are 
perhaps amongst some of the most original cries to be 
heard on the banks of the Tyne. The peculiarly pro- 
longed notes in which the " Buy any fish ? " is called, make 
it very difficult to render accurately.

The " Shares o' caller ling," on the contrary, is given 
much sharper, and repeated very frequently.

They have furthermore been immortalized in verse. I 
am not very certain that the following is correct, but at 
least it is one version of the poem : 

THE CULLERCOATS FISHWIVES. 

" The Cullercoats fishwives so cosy and free, 
They live in their cottages close by the sea, 
And they sell their fine fish 
To the poor and the rich ! 
Will ye buy ? will ye buy ? 
Will ye buy my fine fish ? " 

The old cry of the herring-sellers of Newcastle-upon- 
Tyne was a much more lengthy one, and sometimes con- 
sisted of a set of doggerel verses which, if they were 
approved by the good people of the " canny toon," in those 
bygone days, they must have been scarcely as sensitive and 
refined as one would like to imagine the ancestors of the 
present generation of Novocastrians. 

" 'Ere's yer caller herrin' ! 
'Ere's yer caller fresh herrin' ! 
'Ere's yer 'resh heerin' I 
'Resh heerin' ! 
Power a penny, hinny ! 
Fower a penny ! Fower a penny ! 
Caller heerin' ! " 

Any one who is acquainted with the city on the coaly 
Tyne will recognize in the " Fower a penny " the vernacular 
of the vendors of oranges, who line the streets during the 
winter season, and whose harsh, discordant voices, though 
they may, being so thoroughly Newcastle, be affectionately 
associated with the place in the minds of the natives, will

never, I am afraid, prove sufficiently melodious, even when 
intermixed with the chimes of historic St. Nicholas, to 
suggest so charming an idea as the blending of the cries of 
the Newhaven fishwives with the bells of old St. Giles, 
Edinburgh, did to Lady Nairn. 

" ' Row the boat, Norman, 
Heave and ho, rumbelow.' 

This roundel is to imitate the merry ringing of the 
bells on Lord Mayor's Day. 

"In 1453, Sir John Norman, who was then Lord Mayor 
of London, was the first ' to brake that ancient and olde 
continued custome of riding with great pomp into West- 
minster to take his charge, and chose rather to be rowed 
thither by water.' The watermen made of him a roundel 
or song, to his great praise, 

" ' Row the boat, Norman, 
Heave and ho, rumbelow.' 

The second singer begins two bars after the first, and the 
third two bars after the second. They continue in that 
order, without stopping at the end of the line, but recom- 
mencing and singing it over many times. 



" There seems to be some reason to suppose that this 
was rather Whittington, whose famous mayoralty was 
prior to Norman's. 

" ' Row the boat, Whittington, 

Thou worthy citizen, Lord Mayor of London.' ' 

The above quotations and extracts are again from Mr. 
Chappell's volumes. 1 

D'Israeli, in his " Curiosities of Literature," says, " Our 
sailors at Newcastle, in heaving their anchors, have (still ?) 
their ' Heave and ho, rumbelow,' " and he might have

added that the chief magistrate and corporation of New- 
castle-upon-Tyne still keep up annually one of the most 
ancient water customs, namely, that of going in a procession 
in barges down the River Tyne to inspect the boundaries. 
This ceremony takes place on Ascension Day, or what is 
now commonly known by the good people of the coaly 
metropolis as " Barge Day." 

I wonder if this ancient roundel of the Lord Mayor's 
water-procession suggested Captain Oxenham's song in 
" Westward Ho ! " to Charles Kingsley ? 



CANADIAN BOAT SONGS. 



Peasants in the field, 
Sailors on the roaring ocean, 
Students, tradesmen, pale mechanics, 
All have sung them." 

LONGFELLOW. 



CANADIAN BOAT SONGS. 



ALMOST as celebrated as the sailors' songs of England, 
and the gondoliers' of Venice, are the boat-songs of the 
old Canadian voyageurs. The hymns to their patron 
saint, Saint Anne, that are so popular with the Breton 
fishermen of to-day, all owe their origin to the French- 
Canadian pilgrims of the olden time. The very word 
" Chanty " I have so often made use of in this book, is 
the name originally applied to these boat-songs of Canada, 
derived, of course, from the verb "chanter" (to sing). 

AIR DES BATELIERS DU CANADA. 




This quaint old tune is one of the oldest known boat- 
songs in Canada. 

Moore's " Boat Glee " in " M.P., or The Blue-Stocking," 
is, I believe, supposed to be a translation of one of the 
Canadian voyageurs' songs : 

" The song that lightens the languid way 
When brows are glowing, 
And faint with rowing, 
Is like the spell of Hope's airy lay, 
To whose sound through life we stray. 

K 



130 Music OF THE WATERS. 

The beams that flash on the oar awhile, 
As we row along through waves so clear, 

Illume its spray, like the fleeting smile 
That shines o'er sorrow's tear. 

" Nothing is lost on him who sees 

With an eye that feeling gave, 
For him there's a story in every breeze, 

And a picture in every wave. 
Then sing to lighten the languid way, 

When brows are glowing, 

And faint with rowing, 
Tis like the spell of Hope's airy lay, 
To whose sound through life we pray. " 

I must not omit the same poet's beautiful and ever- 
familiar Canadian boat-song, written on the River St. 
Lawrence. He heard it sung by the voyageurs at St. 
Anne not the St. Anne where the pilgrims go, but a 
village, twenty-one miles from Montreal, on the Ottawa 
r i v e r Sainte Anne de Bellevue, as it is called now, a 
flourishing suburban resort of Montreal. 

" The stream was smooth as glass ; we said, 

' Arise and let's away ! ' 
The siren sang beside the boat 

That in the rushes lay ; 
And spread the sail, and strong the oar, 

We gaily took our way. 
When shall the sandy bar be cross'd ? 
When shall we find the bay ? "

" Faintly as tolls the evening chime,. 
Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time, 
Soon as the woods on shore look dim, 
We'll sing at St. Anne's our parting hymn. 
Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast, 
The rapids are near, and the daylight's past ! 

" Why should we yet our sail unfurl ? 
There is not a breath the blue wave to curl ! 
But when the wind blows off the shore, 
Oh ! sweetly we'll rest our -weary oar. 
Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast, 
The rapids are near, and the daylight's past ! 

" Utawas' tide ! this trembling moon 
Shall see us float over thy surges soon. 
Saint of this green isle ! hear our prayers, 
Oh ! grant us cool heavens and favouring airs. 
Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast, 
The rapids are near, and the daylight's past ! " 

The following is a favourite voyageurs' song : 
V'LA L'BON VENT.

rowing-songs :

English Version. 

" In returning from pretty Rochelle, 
I met three charming demoiselles, 
There's the dear my heart loves, 
There's the dear my heart loves." 

From the Century Magazine (May, 1882), I quote the 
following pilgrim's rowing-song ; it occurs in an article on 
"The Canadian Mecca," by W. George Beers. The 
writer says : " But what song is that stealing over the 
water, like a Canadian voyageur's refrain ? A boat laden 
with pilgrims from the Isle of Orleans is making for our 
shore, and the voices rise and fall with the dip of the oars 
in the true rhythm of the canotier : "

The French-Canadians are a light-hearted, song-loving 
people, and the very poorest amongst them have an in- 
stinctive taste for music ; and many of the boatmen, rafts- 
men and voyageurs among the Iroquois Indians served 
under Lord Wolseley in Egypt, and might often be 
heard singing their quaint old-world songs. I am told 
that the old Province of Quebec has a peculiarly musical 
population.

FRENCH SAILORS' AND BOATMEN'S 
SONGS. 

IN France the system of maritime conscription has been 
brought to almost mechanical perfection, and 172,000 men 
between the ages of eighteen and fifty are inscribed on the 
rolls. It would, however, appear from a statement made 
by the late much-lamented Captain Goodenough, at a re- 
cent discussion at the United Service Institution, that all 
the men liable to the maritime conscription in France are 
not deep-water sailors. The great majority are merely 
fishermen. They have had no experience in large ships 
until they enter the navy. It is not intended to imply a 
doubt of their value as a naval reserve. On the contrary, 
they possess many admirable qualities. Mr. Cripperton, in 
a recent consular report, says of the Breton fishermen on 
the French coast, that " their race forms the admirable sailors 
of whom France is justly proud. Austere in their faith, 
full of trust in Providence, dauntless in danger, patient in 
suffering, bearing deep love, but also profound hate, ever 
ready to lay down their lives when duty or affection re- 
quires, they form an admirable light to the shades adverted 
to in speaking of other classes of the French labouring 
population." It would appear, nevertheless, that the con- 
scription does not always furnish the French Navy with 
men well adapted to the service. This fact cannot be better 
exemplified than by quoting the following paragraph, 
which is given in its original language in Lord Brassey's 
book, "British Seamen" it is taken from Admiral Jurien 
de la Graviere's " La marine d'autre fois " he says, " The 
crew of the Aurora (man-of-war) was composed of con- 



140 Music OF THE WATERS. 

scripts, who had never before even seen the sea, and of 
niggers who had exhausted it in every sense. . . . We 
learnt at length to manage affairs with this mode of recruit- 
ing, but not without infinite care, and if we have succeeded in 
modifying the evils of a system which our inadequate mari- 
time population imposed upon us, it is above all on board 
ships where the importance of the individual is sunk in the 
effort of the many who have to be kept going. It is thus 
not difficult to see that steam has in a most a-propos fashion 
come to take the place of these too numerous super- 
numeraries." 

We hear a great deal in England at the present time 
about Foreign Seamen, and their superiority over the 
British Tar. Lord Brassey, whose very comprehensive 
work on our seamen I have just quoted, referring to 
this, attributes a great part of the unpopularity of our 
sailors to the masters that are set over them. He says, 
quoting Consul Crowe's remarks, " With the school- 
master abroad, and competition rife on every side, it is not 
sufficient that the master is conversant with navigation and 
seamanship ; his education must extend a little further, 
his intellectual and religious character must be raised. If 
you ask why the character of the Norwegian and Swedish 
commercial marine has been rising, commune with masters 
of their merchant-ships, and the mystery will be revealed. 
Just in proportion to their education, their real moral worth, 
and their general knowledge of the world, will they be 
found to rank in the merchants' good books ; and just as 
they rank there will they be found to rank everywhere, at 
home and abroad." How can you expect men to do right 
who spend eleven months cut off from all sources of enjoy- 
ment, and the twelfth surrounded by the strongest tempta- 
tions to sin ? Our sailors are the pioneers of civilization. 
It is from their character and conduct that semi-barbarous 
peoples form their first impressions of our nation. The 
officers on whom such great responsibilities devolve deserve 
the best education it is in our power to bestow. France, 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



141 



like many other nations, is to be congratulated on the 
superiority of its masters. 

My province, however, lies neither with the character of 
the men nor of their masters ; but simply with their songs, 
and lively and song-like as France and the French appear 
to be, there is but little to chronicle with regard to their 
sailors' or fishermen's repertoire. 

Monsieur Paul Sebillot tells me that out of five hundred 
songs he has collected from the peasants and people 
generally of Bretagne, he has rarely come across any at all 
pertaining to the sea. Indeed only some five or six may 
lay claim to the title. 

Bretagne is naturally the coast par excellence of France 
for seamen, and I naturally turned there first for specimens 
of the sea-songs of the country. I give those I have been 
able to obtain. In Provence I have fared a little better, 
though nothing like to the extent I had hoped to do. 

The first is a specimen of the old Corsaire-song of the 
last century :

books on popular traditions, songs, superstitions, legends, 
and every sort of folk-lore. The song of the corsairs he 
introduces in his volume of " Traditions et Superstitions de 
la Haute Bretagne." He says, in speaking of the corsairs, 
"That he has not been able to gather much of their 
history. Their souvenir rests principally in the fishermen's 
songs, and that the one quoted is a favourite with the 
Bretons, and seems to have originated in the latter part of 
the eighteenth century." I have made no attempt at 
rhyme in my translation of the verses of this most truly 
nautical but unpoetical song. The music of it was noted 
by Monsieur Bourgault Du Coudray. In the same work 
Monsieur Sebillot speaks of some extraordinary character- 
istics of the old Breton seamen. One paragraph aroused 
my interest in no small degree ; he says : " I myself have 
met with old sailors whose dream of delight was to be able 
before dying to eat the heart of an Englishman quite raw, 
and one of them it is said, confessed on his death-bed to 
his confessor, that he would not mind stretching a point 
and eating it cooked'' It is to be hoped that in the event 
of this slightly unamiable desire being granted, the indi- 
gestion so richly merited would reward the effort. 

The following song is known as " Les Marins de Groix," 
or " The Sailors of Groix " :

by Monsieur Sebillot. He says it is often repeated, or 
portions of it, in French novels. The sailors of Groix are 
considered very good seamen. Groix is an island situated 
not far from the coast of Morbihan. 

The words that follow are those of a French rowing 
song " La Chanson des Mariniers," or " The Boatmen's 
or Watermen's Song." It also hails from Morbihan :

The French chanty so popularly known as " Ali ! alo ! " 
originates with the sailors and dock-labourers of the Port 
of Dunkerque. So much does its rhythm appeal to them 
that it nearly always serves as the tune for all their " com- 
plaints." Any day in Dunkerque you may hear this 
" Ali ! alo ! " trolled out by dozens of them as you pass 
along the quay. Now it comes from the lips of some 
smart matelot, and the words are as follows :

A genuine complaint this, and, if true, one with a good 
reason. I suppose Ali, alo> may be rendered " Hallo, halli." 
Sometimes the complaint is of a much less refined nature, 
and proceeds from one of the hard-worked labourers, who 
intersperses his song with expressions the reverse of parlia- 
mentary. 

France is a country where the custom of each port 
to have its own particular " chanty " is strictly adhered to. 
There is another song used at Fecamp, which closely re- 
sembles the Dunkerque one just quoted. 

I cannot find any more beautiful illustration of the 
Breton mariner's piety and grand faith than in the follow- 
ing : 

BRETON SAILORS' LITANY. 







Music OF THE WATERS. 



147 







The music is of the truest Breton style, and is known by 
the name of " Er re goli." 



FRENCH VERSION. 

Dieu puissant, notre pere, 
Qui commandez aux flots, 
E^coutez la priere 
Des pauvres matelots. 
Us vous ouvrent leur ame, 
Us vous offrent leurs voeux, 
En priant Notre-Dame 
De prier avec eux. 

Pilote des etoiles 
Qui naviguent aux cieux, 
Seigneur, guidez nos voiles, 
Gardez-nous en tous lieux. 
Quand nous sommes au large 
Ou nous vous invoquons, 
Daignez prendre la charge 
De ceux que nous aimons. 
Quand nous sommes au large 
Ou nous vous invoquons, 
Daignez prendre la charge 
De ceux que nous aimons. 

Veillez sur nos families, 
Protegez nos parents, 
Nos femmes et nos filles, 
Et nos jeunes enfants. 
Nous les laissons a terre, 
En mer nous vous prions 
Pour eux d'etre un bon pere ; 
Nous vous les confions. 

A genoux dans 1'eglise, 
Us demandent pour nous 
Que le temps et la brise 
Comme du miel soient doux. 
Nous, a bord du navire, 
En regardant le ciel, 
Nous oserons vous dire : 
Envoyez-leur le miel ! 

Jesus, sauveur des hommes, 
Soyez notre amiral ! 
Vous voyez qui nous sommes, 
Detournez-nous du mal. 



ENGLISH VERSION. 

God all Powerful, our Father, 
Thou who commandest the sea, 
Listen to the prayer 
Of the poor mariners. 
They open their hearts to Thee, 
They offer to Thee their vows, 
Tn praying the Holy Virgin 
To join her prayers with ours. 

Thou pilot of the stars 
Who steers in the heavens, 
Saviour, guide our sails, 
Guide us wherever we may go. 
When we are on the deep, 
Where we invoke Thy name, 
Take under Thy heavenly care 
All those whom we love. 
When we are on the deep, 
Where we invoke Thy name, 
Take under Thy heavenly care 
All those whom we love. 

Watch over our families, 
Protect our parents, 
Our wives, our daughters, 
And our little children. 
We leave them on shore, 
At sea we pray to Thee 
To be a father to them, 
Whom to Thee we confide. 

On their knees in church 
They ask for us, 
That the weather and the wind 
Be soft and sweet as honey. 
We on board our ship, 
In looking up to heaven, 
We dare to say to Thee : 
Send them the honey. 

Jesus, Saviour of men, 
Be our admiral ! 
Thou knowest who we are, 
Keep us from all evil.

Que votre main puissante, 
Au gre de vos desseins, 
Vers le bien oriente, 
Les coeurs de vos marins. 

Dieu des misericordes 
Abaissez vos regards 
Sur nos mats et nos cordes, 
Quand, parmi les brouillards, 
A la cape, en derive, 
Affales sous le vent, 
Nous sommes vers la rive 
Drosses par le courant. 

Pour notre sauvetage, 
Patron des sauveteurs, 
Donnez-nous bon courage 
En nous rendant meilleurs. 
Preservez-nous du vice, 
Et qu'apres notre mort 
Notre barque atterrisse 
Pres de vous a bon port. 



Let Thy powerful hand 
Guided by Thy desire, 
At the golden harbour land 
The hearts of Thy sailors. 

God of all mercy, 
Bend we pray Thy looks 
On our ropes and sails, 
When we are in danger. 
At the cape, we drift 
Weighed down with the wind, 
And make towards the shore 
Driven by the tide. 

For our salvation, 
Patron of Saviours, 
Give us help and courage 
By making us better. 
Keep us from all vice, 
And after our death 
Let our barque come safely 
To the haven of Thy love. 



It is impossible to translate the full beauty of this 
exquisite poem. It was given to me by an English lady 
who was for many years resident in Brittany, and whom I 
met accidentally whilst travelling one day. We had some 
conversation, in the course of which she asked me if I knew 
Brittany ? I told her I did not. She then spoke of the 
fishermen and seamen generally of that part, and told me 
some stories of the extraordinary superstition that exists 
among them. " They have some nice customs, too," she 
added, " for instance, a beautiful litany which they chant 
before going on a voyage ; I heard it several times and got 
one of the old fishermen to repeat it to me while I wrote it 
down, and I also procured the music. I have been thinking 
lately of sending it to a young lady in the North of England, 
whom I understand is collecting the sailors' songs of all 
nations ; I am sure she will like to have it for her book/' 

I told her how glad I should be to have it, and after 
a little more talking 1 reached my destination. A few 
days later the Litany and a very kind letter were sent me 
by my travelling- companion, and a request that I would 
translate the verses as literally as possible, so that the 
fervour of the Breton religion might not be destroyed for 
the sake of a rhymed version. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



149 



The songs which follow are well known, being always 
sung to the same tune, whereas many of the Provencal 
fishermen's favourites are sung to so many different airs 
that they end by having no special identity. Their verses 
are all of a romantic type, and very touching. Some of 
those which follow are peculiar to the sardine fishers, but I 
am not quite certain which they are. Marseilles ought to 
have some local chanties, but, if it has, the sailors are 
loth to make them public property. I believe it was of 
Marseilles that the verses in which the following lines 
occur were written : 



<l Where the mud lies black and shiny, 

Where the waters sweep along, 
Where the wharfmen stout and grimy 
Heave and haul with many a song." 

At the moment I am just in receipt of a song from the 
South of France, said to be a great favourite with the 
sailors in that part of the country. It is known as " Le 
Petit Navire," and, as it was sent to me with the following 
accompaniment, I have just given it as sent :

II etait un petit navire, 
II etait un petit navire, 
Qui n'avait jamais navigue 
Qui n'avait jamais navigue. 

Au bout de cinq a six semaines 
Les vivres vinrent a manquer. 

On fit tirer la courte paille, 
Pour savoir qui serait mange. 



Le sort tomba sur le plus jeune 
En sauce blanche il fut mange. 



ENGLISH VERSION. 

There was once a little ship, 
There was once a little ship, 
Which never, never sailed, 
Which never, never sailed. 

At the end of five or six weeks 
Provisions began to fail the crew. 

They drew lots with pieces of straw, 
To know which of them should be 
eaten. 

The lot fell on the youngest ; 

In white sauce he was to be eaten.

II monta sur le mat de hune 
Et vit la mer de tous cotes. 

" O Sainte Vierge, O ma patronne, 
Preservez-moi de ce danger." 



He climbed the topmast, 
And saw the sea on every side. 

" O holy Virgin, guardian saint, 
Preserve me from this danger." 



The prayer must have been granted, for the song ends 
here. As will be seen by the first verse set to the music, 
each line throughout is repeated. 



SONGS OF PROVENCE. 

The following song is a very old one, and has for years 
and years been popular amongst the sailors of fair Pro- 



vence :

Is gone for the transport,

This song, which was translated for me by Monsieur G. 
Borell, professor of music at Aix-en-Provence, from the 
native Provence into French, is somewhat difficult to render 
in English ; one or two words are beyond translation. 

Several more verses of the next fisherman's song were 
sent to me, but as no French translation accompanied 
them, I think it scarcely worth while inserting them, as I 
doubt if the Prove^al language is known to many English 
people ; the music, however, is so pretty that I have deemed 
it worth a place.

LA BARQUE DU PECHEUR. 
FRENCH VERSION. 



Seul dans sa nacelle 

Au declin du jour, 

Le pecheur fidele 

Chante son amour. 

Mais les vents barbares 

Rompent les amarres, 

Et 1'onde en fureur 

Ronle la barque du pecheur ; 

Et 1'onde en fureur 

Roule la barque du pecheur. 

En voyant ses rames 
Sur des boros cheris, 
Aux fracas des lames 
11 mele ses cris, 
Pleurant sa chaumiere, 
11 songe a sa mere ; 
Mais 1'onde en fureur 
Roule la barque du pecheur. 

Sur la mer profonde 
Trois nuits et trois jours, 
La mer vagabond e 
Roule sans secours. 



THE FISHERMAN'S BARX. 
ENGLISH VERSION. 

Alone in his skiff, 

At the close of day, 

The faithful fisherman 

Sings of his love. 

But the barbarous winds 

Cut his moorings, 

And the fury of the wave 

Rocks the fisherman's bark ; 

And the fury of the wave 

Rocks the fisherman's bark. 

In seeing his oars 
On the crested wave, 
With the roar of the billows 
He blends his cries, 
Bewailing his hut, 
He thinks of his mother ; 
But the fury of the wave 
Rocks the fisherman's bark. 

On the deep sea 

Three days and three nights, 

On the roving sea 

He rocks without help.

II sourit d'espoir ; 

Mais loin de 1'espace, 

Ou le vaisseau passe,

The vessel passes,

Notre vaisseau sur 1'onde am ere 
Voguait sans bruit, voguait sans bruit, 
Quand une voix plaintive et douce 
Tout bas chantait, tout bas chantait, 
C'etait la voix d'un jeune mousse, 
Qui rep^tait, qui repetait, 
Adieu, beau ciel de ma Bretagne 
Et ma promise et mes amours, 
Adieu, ma mere et ma compagne, 
Je vous regretterai toujours. 

Nous etions entre ciel et terre, 
Et loin du port, et loin du port, 
Sa plainte a la brise legere 
Disait encor, disait encor, 
Qui me rendra de mon rivage 
Les bords cheris, les bords cheris, 
Et les sentiers de mon village 
Toujours fleuris, toujours fleuris, 
Et les sentiers de mon village, 
Toujours fleuris, toujours fleuris? 

Ou done est mon humble masure 

De Landernau, de Landernau ? 

Car le clocher c'est la mature 

De mon vaisseau, de mon vaisseau. 

Je ne vois plus que les mouettes 

Qui sur les mers, qui sur les mers, 

Ont remplace les paquerettes 

De mes pres verts, de mes pres verts. 



Nous etions entre ciel et terre, 
Et grace au vent, et grace au vent, 
Le brik enfin touchait la terre, 
Le jour suivant, le jour suivant, 
Apres sa longue traversee, 
II tend les bras, il tend les bras, 
A sa mere, a sa fiangee ; 
II dit tout bas, il dit tout bas, 
Salut, beau ciel de ma Bretagne 
Salut, mon pays, mes amours ! 
Salut, ma mere et ma compagne, 
Je reviens a vous pour toujours.

Our ship on the salt wave 
Floated silently, floated silently, 
When a voice plaintive and sweet, 
Quite softly sang, quite softly sang ; 
It was the voice of a little cabin boy, 
Who repeated, who repeated, 
Adieu, lovely sky of my Brittany 
And my beloved and my loves, 
Adieu, my mother and my friend, 
I must always regret you. 

We were between heaven and earth, 

And far from port, and far from port, 

His wail on the light breeze 

Said again, said again, 

Who will give me back my shore, 

The beloved banks, the beloved 

- banks, 

And the paths of my village, 

Always in flower, always in flower ? 

Where is now my humble cottage 
Of Landernau, of Landernau ? 
Now my home is under the mast 
Of my vessel, of my vessel. 
I only now see the sea-gulls 
Which on the sea, which on the sea, 
Have replaced the daisies 
Of my green meadows, of my green 
meadows. 

We were between heaven and earth, 
And thanks to the wind, and thanks 

to the wind, 

The keel at last touched the earth. 
The following day, the following 

day, 

After his long voyage, 
He holds out his arms, he holds out 

his arms, 

To his mother, to his betrothed ; 
He says quite low, he says quite 

low, 
I greet the bright sky of my dear 

Brittany, 
Welcome, my country, my best 

beloved ! 

I greet my mother and my companion, 
I a.m come back to you for ever. 

THE FISHERMAN.

Lighter than the swallow, 
Lightly my pretty skiff 
Skims gracefully over the waters. 
She bounds along, proud and co-

Music OF THE WATERS. 



Semblant defier la tempete 
Et le choc terrible des flots. 
Tra la, la, la, la. 

Seul au milieu de 1'onde 
Quand je vogue, ma foi, 
Le plus grand roi du monde 
Est moins heureux que moi. 
Tra la, la, la, la, 
Tra la, Ja, la, la, 
Tra la, la, la, la. 

Je ne possede pour richesse 
Que Ninna, ma belle maitresse, 
Mes filets, ma nacelle, et Dieu. 
Et qu'a-t-il besoin de fortune 
Celui que le monde importune, 
Et qui se contente de peu ? 
Tra la, la, la, la. 

Qu'apres une gloire ephemere 
Les ambitieux de la terre 
Insenses passent tous les jours. 
Pietro le pecheur est plus sage, 
En depit du vent, de 1'orage, 
Joyeux il repete toujours 
Tra la, la, la, la, 
Tra la, la, la, la. 



Seeming to defy the tempest 

And the terrible dashing of the waves. 

Tra la, la, la, la. 

Alone in the midst of the waves 
When I am floating, my faith, 
The greatest king in the world 
Is less to be envied than me. 
Tra la, la, la, la, 
Tra la, la, la, la, 
Tra la, la, la, la. 

I only own as riches 

Nina, my lovely queen, 

My nets, my skiff, and my God. 

"What need has he of fortune 

Whom the world importunes, 

And who is content with little ? 

Tra la, la, la, la. 

The ambitious people of the earth 
Stupidly pass all their days 
In seeking an ephemeral glory. 
Peter the fisherman is wiser, 
In spite of the wind and the storm, 
Joyful he ever repeats 
Tra la, la, la, la, 
Tra la, la, la, la. 



LA CHANSON DU MOUSSE. 
FRENCH VERSION. 

La mer est ma patrie, 
Ce bord est mon sejour ; 
J'y dois passer ma vie, 
J'y dois mourir un jour. 
Va, petit mousse, 
Dans un climat lointain, 
La mer est douce 
Pour le pauvre orphelin. 

La vie est bien amere 
A 1'enfant delaisse, 
Que 1'amour d'une mere 
N'ajamais caresse. 
Va, petit mousse, 
Dans un climat lointain, 
La mer est douce 
Pour le pauvre orphelin. 

Je vais loin de toi, ma belle, 
Conserve mon amour ; 
Je reviendrai, je 1'espere, 
Pour nous unir un jour. 
Va, petit mousse, 
Dans un climat lointain, 
La mer est douce 
Pour le pauvre orphelin. 



THE CABIN BOY'S SONG. 
ENGLISH VERSION. 

The sea is my kingdom, 

This shore is my holiday home ; 

I have to live my life here, 

And here I must one day die. 

Go, little cabin boy, 

To a distant clime, 

The sea is calm 

For a poor orphan boy. 

Life is very sad 
To the lonely child, 
Whom a mother's love 
Has never caressed. 
Go, little cabin boy, 
To a distant clime, 
The sea is calm 
For a poor orphan boy. 

I am going far from thee, my sweet, 

Keep thou my love ; 

I will return, I hope, 

And then one day we'll wed. 

Go, little cabin boy, 

To a distant clime, 

The sea is calm 

For a poor orphan boy.

Many will be familiar with the two French sea-songs 
which follow, " Pauvre Pierre " and the lovely " Une Fleur 
pour Reponse." They are great favourites amongst the 
sailors. I well remember hearing a splendid old Breton 
mariner singing the latter; there was a whole world of 
pathos in his way of rendering it, and of unconscious 
rugged grandeur in the picture he himself presented.

Je pars ; adieu, Marie ! Helas, je pars

Si vous me regrettez, oh ! je vous en 

supplie, 
Donnez-moi cette fleur, cherie, que 

toucha votre main !

Et, loin de vous, cette rose fanee

La pauvre enfant, qui tremblait a sa 

vue, 
Triste et reveuse, implorait Dieu tout 

bas! 

Et lui, reprit, d'une voix plus emue, 
" Vous vous taisez ! oh ! vous ne 

m'aimez pas ; 
Je pars, Tame fletrie ! Adieu ! je pars 

demain." 
II allait s'eloigner, quand cette fleur 

cherie, 
Seule reponse de Marie, s'echappa de 

sa main. 



I am going ; adieu, Marie ! Alas, I 

leave to-morrow ! 

If you will regret me, oh ! I beg you, 
Give me that flower, darling, your 

hand has touched ! 



" If that flower were given me by you, 
Even in leaving I should feel some 

joy! 
And when far away from you, that 

faded rose 
Will be ever, ever there, on my 

heart ! " 

The poor child trembled 'neath his 

gaze, 
Sad and dreaming she implored God's 

help ! 
And he in a voice both tender and 

reproachful, 
Said, " You are silent, ah ! you do not 

love me ; 
I am going, my heart is wounded ! 

Adieu, I go to-morrow." 
He was turning away, when that 

cherished flower, 
Sole answer from Marie, was dropped 

from her hand.

La voile s'enfle, il va partir, le brick 

a 1'allure elegante ; 
Sur le pont le matelot chante, in- 

soucieux de 1'avenir, 
Mais 1'ceil fixe sur 1'onde amere, un 

seul la regarde en pleurant, 
Car sur la greve il voit sa mere, qui 

pleure et benit son enfant. 

Un jour, helas ! le pain manquait a sa 

famille desolee, 
Et sous la cabane isolee, deja 1'horrible

sur la plaine-ecumeuse,

ENGLISH VERSION. 

The sails are set of the gallant brig, 
On deck the sailor sings, regardless 

of the future ; 
But with his gaze fixed on the bitter 

wave one is silently crying, 
For on the shore he sees his mother 

weeping and blessing her child. 

One day, alas ! bread failed the deso- 
late family, 

And into the isolated cabin, already 
hunger in its horror has entered^ 

But Peter runs towards the port, sells 
himself, and comes back weeping, 

"Mother," says he, "no more pain, 
embrace and bless thy child ! " 

Departed to far distant climes, wan- 
dering over the foaming plain, 

After a stormy voyage, the good 
Peter never comes back ; 

And on the lonely shore washed by 
the incoming tide, 

Each day sees the poor mother pray- 
ing and weeping for her child. 



The story of " Pauvre Pierre " is an undoubted forecastle 
favourite with Jack in France. 

This is another very favourite song in Provence with the 
fishermen :

Music OF THE WATERS.

In a course of more than a hundred and eighty leagues, 
the " corn-coloured river," as an old chronicle calls the 
Loire, flows through meadows, vineyards, woods, and great 
cities, without once finding a barren or a desert spot. 
From its source to the sea, on either side, the eye sees 
only flocks feeding, chimneys smoking, and ploughmen 
who seem singing at their ploughs. The stream glides 
noiselessly over its sandy bed among islets nodding their 
plumes of osier, willow, and poplar. In all the landscape 
there is a delightful though rather unvarying softness, a 
subdued quiet, which gives to everything around you that 
attractiveness which is somehow always found with affluence 
and ease. It is almost a piece of Arcadia, with more water 
and less scud. Upon the river dwell a race who partake of 
its character. They have not the jeering turbulence of the 
Seine boatmen, nor the sullen fierceness of those of the 
Rhone, nor the heaviness of the men who navigate the 
Rhine. The bargeman of the Loire is of a peaceful dis- 
position ; vigorous without coarseness, and merry without 
excess, he lets his life flow on through things as he finds 
them, like the water which carries him between its fertile 
banks. With a few exceptions, he has no restraints of locks, 
no hard labour at the oar, no tedious towing work to 
undergo. The wind, which finds free course through the 
immense basin of the river, enables him to sail both up and 
down. Standing at the enormous helm, the boatmaster 
attends only to the course of the barge, while his mates 
help it along by " spurring " the bottom of the water with 
iron-shod poles. At intervals, a few words are exchanged 



Music OF THE WATERS. 161 

in the loud tone of people accustomed to talk in the 
open air ; the youngster hums the famous song of " The 
Bargemen of the Loire ; " the barge that meets them gets a 
merry cheer as it passes, or gives them some useful bit of 
news ; and in this way they all reach the evening's 
anchorage, where the crews who have had equal luck of 
wind and tide during the day, meet together at the public- 
house patronized by " the River Service." 

The following verses are often to be heard sung by these 
bargemen, rarely twice to the same tune, sometimes an opera 
air is used, anon a hymn tune, anything that adapts itself 
to the singer's feelings and the rhythm of the words. 

I do not know whether it is generally known that the 
Vaudeville is really an early form of French water-song. 
It originated with the workmen of a fuller of Vau de 
Vire, or the valley by the River Vire ; these men used to 
sing while spreading their cloths on the banks of the 
river, usually the subject was some incident or adventure of 
the day, and thus from Vau de Vire we get the Vaudeville. 
It seems strange that so rustic a custom should have 
originated the gayest songs of France. The Sanjaneus are 
credited with the authorship of this comical little song : 

" Fisher, fishing in the sea ; 
Fish my mistress up for me. 
Fish her up before she drowns 
Thou shalt have four hundred crowns. 
Fish her for me dead and cold 
Thou shalt have my all in gold." 

The following famous song of the Rhone I have given in 
its entirety, as it is well deserving of the space it takes up. 
It is " Le Revestidon, ou Les Equipages du Rhone " " The 
Revestidon, or the Boats' Crews of the Rhone/' The 
Revestidon means one of the pontoons for embarking and 
debarking from the steamboats which ply between Lyons 
and Avignon. I am again indebted to Monsieur Borel for 
his translation of the Proven 9al version ; indeed, what

Monsieur Sebillot has done for me in Brittany and the 
North of France generally, Monsieur Borel has done in 
Provence and the South. Had all my applications for 
information respecting the sailors' and fishermen's songs of 
a country met with one half the courtesy and extremely 
kind help that have been shown them in France, I should 
have found my task a much less formidable undertaking ; it 
is, perhaps, by contrasting the unresponsive and many times 
indifferent treatment of other nations that the kindness and 
cordiality of the land of the arrowy Rhone, and corn- 
coloured Loire, stands out in such shining characters.

Grands, beaux, et forts, plains de 

souplesse, 

Jarrets tendus, suants, courbes, 
La maille, a la barque maitresse, 
Par quatre vous tient accouples. 

Et centre 1'eau le train remonte, 

A la file les bateaux vont ; 

II vente, il pleut, rien ne vous 

dompte, 
Pluie et soleil rien ne vous font. 



Suivant les sentes marinieres, 
L'on vous voit piaffer et nager ; 
Vous traversez ruisseaux, rivieres, 
Sans jamais vous decourager. 



Et soit d'Arles, soit de Beaucaire, 
De Tarascon ou d'Avignon. 
Vous amenez, n'arretant guere, 
Le chargement jusqu'a Lyon. 

Que de villes, que de villages, 
Que de montagnes, de chateaux, 
Les marins, pendant ces voyages, 
Ont vus du pont de leurs bateaux 



Tout en naviguant, leurs pensees 
A ceux qu'ils ont laisses seulets, 
S'en vont, doucement caressee*, 
Des femmes aux enfantelots. 



Mais voici 1'endroit difficile, 
Le Revestidon redoute, 
Chevaux, allez d'un pas tranquille, 
Et ne marchez point a cote. 



Les six bateaux, on les separe, 
Et deux par deux ils sont passes, 
Chevaux et gens, dans la bagarre, 
Luttant centre eau, sable et fosses. 



Prepares au mauvais passage, 
Bravement ils en sont sortis, 
Et les marins, selon 1'usage, 
Dissent, "Nous sommes revesti ! " 

Puis la troupe s'en est allee 
Vers le plus grand mas du terroir ; 
Sous les peupliers de 1'allee, 
A la Durbane on va s'asseoir. 



Big, beautiful, strong and supple, 
With legs distended, sweating and 

bent, 

The ring to the principal boat, 
By four together holds you coupled. 

And against the tide the train 

remounts, 

In file the boats go by ; 
It may blow, it may rain, but nothing 

stops you, 
Rain and sun are all one to you. 

Following the mariner's path 
One can see you pawing and swim- 
ming, 

Over streams and rivers you go 
With an almost indomitable courage." 

Be it from Aries, or Beaucaire, 
From Tarascon or Avignon, 
You take the cargo to Lyons, 
Scarely without stopping. 

What numbers of towns and villages, 
What mountains, what castles, 
Must the sailors have seen 
From the bridge of their boats during 
these voyages ! 

As they sail their thoughts fly 

To those whom they have left all 

alone. 

Their thoughts fly as softly caressed 
As women caress their children. 

But here comes the most difficult 

part, 

The Revestidon so feared, 
" Horses ! go, step quietly, 
And don't walk to the side." 

The six boats are then separated, 
And two by two they pass it ; 
Horses and men in the hubbub 
Fighting against water, sand, and 
ditches. 

Prepared for the bad passage, 
Bravely they come through it, 
And the sailors, according to custonr, 
Say, " We are revesti." 

Then the troops go off 

Towards the biggest farm in the 

district ; 

Under the poplars of the walks, 
At the Durbane they go and sit 

down.

Music OF THE WATERS. 



On trouve la superbe etable ; 
Cent chevaux n'y seraient point mal. 
On y boit le vin delectable 
De Chateauneuf, le vin papal. 

Et la table est si bien servie ! 
Plus d'un s'en donne tout son soul. 
Oh ! la nuit est bient6t finie ! 
L'on est si joyeux chez " Pecoul ! " 

A la paresse cherchant noise, 
II faut regagner les bateaux ; 
Adieu, done, la belle bourgeoise ! 
A Lyon nous serrons bientot. 

Et la rejane, la grand maille, 
Et tous chevaux sont rattaches ; 
Betes et gens, chacun travaille, 
Tout attentifs, Ton voit penches. 

Patron et second a la poupe, 
De vin point on ne manquera ; 
Le petit mousse fait la soupe ; 
A son tour chacun dormira. 



Et de nouveau file la troupe 
De chevaux, d'hommes doux et forts ; 
11 va peinant, le vaillant groupe, 
Sans jamais se plaindre du sort. 

Son voyage est comme la vie : 
Tristesse et gaiete, froid et cliaud ; 
Les jours passent, 1'ceuvre est finie : 
Au bout du travail le repos. . . 

" Fais tirer, mon brave equipage ; 
Mes septante chevaux, filez, 
Du Rh6ne il est fier le rivage, 
Quand bravement vous le foulez." 



There they find superb stabling ; 

A hundred horses would not do 

badly in it. 

They drink delectable wine, 
Chateauneuf, the papal wine. 

And the table is so well served, 
More than one drinks his fill ! 
Ah ! ah ! the night is soon over. 
One is so joyful at " Pecoul's ! " 

With idleness they soon quarrel, 
They must regain the boats ; 
" Good-bye, then, pretty peasant! 
At Lyons we soon shall be." 

And then the rejane, the great maille ! 
And all horses are harnessed ; 
Beasts and men, each one works, 
All attention one sees them. 

Coxswain and second mate at the 

stern, 

No one will want for wine ; 
The little cabin-boy makes the soup ; 
In his turn each will sleep. 

And again the troop files along, 
Of horses and men, weak and strong ; 
It goes labouring, the valiant group, 
Without complaining of their lot. 

Their voyage is like life : 
Sadness and gaiety, cold and heat ; 
The days go by, the work is finished : 
At the end of labour comes rest. 

"Pull, then, my noble crew ; 
My seventy horses, fly ; 
The strand of the Rhone is proud 
When bravely you crowd by." 



When the boatmen of the Rhone wished to indicate to 
which side of the river the train of boats had to go, to right 
or to left, they cried " Reiaume " or " Empeire," because in 
the Middle Ages the banks on the right of the Rhone were 
the possessions of the kings of France, and on the left were 
the provinces of our actual France, taken from the Empire 
of Germany. 

The ancient crews for remounting the course of the 
Rhone were often composed of six or seven boats, and of 
sixty to ninety horses. These animals were coupled by 
fours together, and the great " Maio," the " Rejano," the 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



165 



" Carato," &c., were the principal cables and tow-ropes 
that tied the horses to the boats. They designated, under 
the names of front winds and back winds, the first and 
the last horse of the file of those horses of the towing-path. 
Each quadriga with its " baile " or conductor, and the conduc- 
tor of the foremost quadriga, were named " baile premier." 

The Durbane was a large farm, with beautiful shady 
walks of poplars and elms. It was in the old days a 
public-house of considerable dimensions and repute, and 
" Joseph Pecoul," who is alluded to in one of the verses, 
was the last of the great publicans of the Durbane. 

Perhaps I may be permitted to quote some verses from 
Guillaume de la Landelle's dedicatory poem to sailors, with 
which he prefaces his " Le Gaillard d'Avant." 



Matelots, bon peuple marin, 
Votre ronde gaiete m'est chere, 
Car je suis un ami sincere 
Et quelque peu votre cousin. 

J'ai partage votre destin 
Et vu de pres votre misere, 
Je sais qu'une chanson legere 
A bord dissipe le chagrin. 

Et c'est pourquoi j'ai fait ce livre 
Recueilli dans vos nobles coeurs, 
Au gaillard d'avant je le livre. 



Vous en etes les vrais auteurs ; 
Moi, j'ai simplement mis en rimes 
Vos tranches vertus maritimes. 



J'emprunte a votre magasin 
Tous mes airs; pouvais-je 

faire ? 

Et dans votre vocabulaire 
Je navigue mon droit chemin. 



Sailors, brave sons of the ocean, 
Your sunny nature pleases me, 
For I am your sincere friend, 
Your cousin I might almost be. 

I have often shared your lot 
And have seen you in your pain, 
And I know how much on board 
May be done by some joyous strain. 

And that is why I have written this 

book 
Of the songs that live in your noble 

hearts, 
And I inscribe it to the "Foc'sle 

Head." 

You are really the authors of it ; 
I have simply put in rhyme 
The frank simplicity of your sailor 
life. 

I borrow from your varied store 
All my tunes ; could I do better ? 
And through your strange vernacular 
Keep to the very letter. 



De la Landelle seems to have been to France what Mr. 
Clarke Russell is to England at the present time, namely, 
the true chronicler of the sailors' sayings and doings, and 
the genuine historian of the curiosities and credulities of 
the foc'sle-head and the galley fire. De la Landelle's volume

Music OF THE WATERS. 



(" Poemes et Chants Marins "; is the nearest approach to 
Dibdin's style of writing of any that I have found, and is full 
of songs that are often to be heard on the decks of French 
ships ; some few of them may be said to be of the genuine 
chanty type. He also published a very interesting volume, 
" Le Langage des Marins," which gives ample evidence of 
the study he has made of seamen and of their extraordinary 
vernacular. 

The following is the French fishermen's " Hymn to Saint 
Anne":

Music OF THE WATERS. 169 

I could not attempt a translation of this last ; it is essentially 
French, almost a Vaudeville in character, and possessing 
as sole merit the gaiety which is inseparable from that 
class of French song. To France, I think, belongs the dis- 
tinction of having produced some of the saddest and most 
of the brightest songs in the world. They have a saying 
that, " A song without its tune is a bird without its wings " 
(" Un chanson sans son air est un oiseau sans ses ailes "), 
and it is peculiarly true of their songs ; words and music 
are so absolutely wedded, that to sever them is to lose half 
their beauty. But, sad or gay, they are all dear to the song- 
loving French, and from the haunting sorrow that breathes 
through every line of Alfred de Musset's " Rappelle- 

Tot-V- 

" Rappelle-toi quand 1'aurore craintive," 
to 

" Au clair de la lune, 
Mon ami Pierrot, 
Pretes-moi ta plume 
Pour ecrire un mot ! " 

all are beloved, all are popular, on sea and on shore ; 
and so, quoting the words of the French " King of 
Songsters," Beranger, I bid adieu to the blue-jackets of 
that country : 

" Go, then, and let the rising race through thee that history 

know ; 

Be thou a pilot to their bark, the rocks and sands to show ; 
And if perchance the pride of France some day they help 

to raise, 

Go, in their beams of glory warm thine own declining 
days ; 

Adieu then, songs, adieu ! "

ITALIAN FISHERMEN'S AND SAILORS' 

SONGS. 

ITALIAN HYMN. 




EVERY child from his cradle upwards has heard of Italy 
as the land of music. The world is indebted to it for all 
that makes the beauty of the art, and for much of its 
science. Overflowing with natural beauty, rich in historical 
associations, and in relics which set these forth, peopled by 
those who are brimful of natural aptitude and that quick 
nervous sensibility which is so important an element of 
musical genius, who does not look to Italy as the " Land 
of Harmony," with its fascinating coast-line, its northern 
lakes, Naples with its beautiful bay, and Venice with its 
lazy lagoons ? 

What music in France owes to the intellectual predilec- 



174 Music OF THE WATERS. 

tions of the people, in Italy is due to the strong emotions 
and passionate nature of her natives. In Italy the mari- 
time population amounts to 225,000, of this the greater 
part are fishermen, though a large number man the 
Genoese barques in the general carrying trade. 

The songs of the fishermen and Lazzaroni of Naples are 
full of whimsical nonsense and impudence, many of them 
are merely the popular tunes of the day ; but, like those of 
Venice, the sound of the boat, with its cadence of rowers, is 
ever and again heard. 

The Mediterranean sailor is popularly supposed to 
chant snatches of opera over his fishing-nets ; but, after all, 
his is only a larger sort of lake, with water of a question- 
able saltness. Sir John Hamner's exquisite sonnet, " The 
Finmara," or " The Old Fisher," is an admirable picture of 
those poor creatures, whose living, if it may be so called, 
is made by fishing for a few sardines in the blue waters of 
the Mediterranean : 

" Thou art a fisher of Mazorbo ; lone, 
Drifting a usual shadow o'er the sea, 
With thine old boat, that like a barkless tree 
Creaks in the wind a pitiless dreary moan ; 
And there thy life and all thy thoughts have flown, 
Pouncing on crabs in shallows, till thy knees 
Crooked as theirs, now halt unsteadily, 
Going about to move the anchor-stone ; 
And when the waves roll inward from the east, 
Takest thy net, and for some few sardines 
Toil'st in the morning's wild and chilly ray. 
Then dost thou go to where yon bell-tower leans, 
And in the sunshine sit, the poor man's feast, 
Else abstinent in thy poverty, all the day." 

Mazorbo, a sea-port of Sicily, where is often witnessed 
the approach of the Marobea, a violent agitation of the sea, 
announced by the stillness in the atmosphere and a lurid

sky. The Mediterranean can furnish dangerous enough 
storms upon occasion, and far worse than storms, the 
terrible white squall which lies ambushed under sunny 
skies, and leaps unawares upon the doomed vessel. But 
the Mediterranean is not the deep sea, nor has it produced 
the best and boldest navigators, therefore, although we still 
seek the sources of our maritime law amid the rock-poised 
huts (once palaces) of Amalfi, we must go elsewhere for our 
true songs of the sea. 

" Borne on 

Beyond Sorrento and Amalfi, where 
The siren waits thee, singing song for song." 

The following song of the well-known composer of 
Italian popular songs Paolo Tosti is a great favourite 
with the sailors of Italy : 



PERCHfe VUOI TU FIDAS LA BARCA AL MARE. 

Assai moderato, 

"it. ^ ^ ^ j^ a tempo. 




1 N-K-^S j-iil-l !v ff 



^\ 






At least, this is the title by which the song is known, but 
the sailors will improvise their own words to the air, 
probably of some droll, lazy, impudent nature, such as 
delight the hearts of the fishermen of that town of glorious 
colours, softest lights, and sweetest sounds Naples. 

In a very able article (in the Atlantic Monthly of 
October, 1858), entitled the " Language of the Sea," we learn 
how much we are indebted to Italy for the language that 



176 Music OF THE WATERS. 

is known as .that of the sea. " Upon the Italian main the 
words ' tack ' and ' sheet,' ' prow ' and ' poop/ were first 
heard ; and those most important terms by which the law 
of the marine highwaj' is given ' starboard ' and ' lar- 
board.' For if, after the Italian popular method, we con- 
tract the words ' questo bordo ' (this side) and ' quello 
bordo ' (that side) into sto bordo and lo bordo, we 
have the roots of our modern phrases. And so the 
term ' port,' which in naval usage supersedes * larboard,' is 
the abbreviated porta lo timone (carry the helm), which, 
like the same term in military usage, ' port arms,' seems 
traditionally to suggest the left hand. The three masts of 
a ship are known as ' fore,' ' main,' and * mizzen ; ' of these, 
the first is English, the second, Norman-French, and the 
third, Italian (mezzano). Your seaman's tongue is a true 
bed of Procrustes for the unhappy words that roll over it. 
They are docked without mercy, or now and then, when 
not properly mouth-filling, they are ' spliced ' with a couple 
of vowels. It is impossible to tell the whys and wherefores 
of sea-prejudices. . . . Sailors have indeed a passion for 
metamorphosing words, especially proper names. The 
Bellerophon of the British navy was always known as the 
'Bully-Ruffian? and the Ville de Milan, a French prize, as 
the * Wheel 'em along? . . . For the sea has a language, 
beyond a peradventure, an exceedingly arbitrary, technical, 
and perplexing one, unless it be studied with the illustrated 
grammar of the full-rigged ship before one, with the added 
commentaries of the sea and the sky and the coast-chart. 
To learn to speak it requires about as long as to learn to 
converse passably in French, Italian, or Spanish, and 
unless it be spoken well, it is exceedingly absurd to any 
appreciative listener." 

If Italy then is not rich in sea-songs, she is at least the 
nurse or foster-mother of many sea-terms which play an 
important part in those songs that are sung on board 
vessels of other nationality.

SANTA LUCIA. 




This well-known song is often sung by the fishermen of 
Naples, the gondoliers of Venice, and Italian seamen 
generally. It is truly of the barcarolla type, and seems 
thoroughly suited to water pursuits. I give the translation 
of the words

The following charming song is well known as a boatman's 
favourite ; it is " The Amalfi Boatmen's Serenade " : 



LA FATA DI AMALFI. 

ITALIAN VERSION. 
Chiagnaro-r6 la la mia sventura 
Si non tuorne chiu, Rosella ! 
Tu d' Amalfi la chiu bella, 
Tuna Fata si peme ! 
Viene vie, regina mia ; 
Viene, curre a chi-sto core, ca non 

c' e, 

Non c' e no sciore, 
Non c' e Stella comm' a te ! 

Co chi parlo ? Ahi sconsolato ! 
Addo sta la rosa mia ? 
S' e sfrunnata pe la via, 
E chiu addore non me da ! 
No signore la vedette, 
So tre mise ch' e scappata ; 
Ma co tut to ch' e na sgrata 
Non la pozzo io maie scorda ! 

La matina che pe tiempo, 
Vaco a Napole mbarchetta, 
Pare tanno che m' aspetta 
E la mano me vo da ! 
Quanno po lo cielo scura, 
Ed io vaco pe piscare, 
Miezo a 1' onne de lo mare, 
Veco pure che sta Ik I 

E turnanno, a la capannn, 
La saluto a lo barcone, 
E la solita canzona 
Taco tanno pe canta : 
Viene vie, turi na stella, 
Vu d' Amalfi si la fata ; 
Ma la rosa s' e sfrunnata, 
Ed io 1' aggio da scorda ! 



THE FAIRY OF AMALFI. 

ENGLISH VERSION. 
I'll bewail my misfortune 
If thou returnest not, Rosella ! 
Thou, the fairest of Amalfi, 
Art indeed a fairy to me. 
Come, come my queen, 
Come fly to this heart ; 
There is no flow'r to compare with 

thee, 
Nor a star like as thou art ! 

With whom do I speak ? Alas ! dis- 
consolate, 

Where is my rose to be found ? 
It has been plucked by the way, 
Its odour no longer floats round. 
Won by the gaze of a master, 
It is three months now since she fled ; 
But although thus cruel to me 
.Her memory is not dead. 

When on every morning early, 
I with my boat to Naples go ; 
It seems to me that she'll be waiting, 
To put her hand in mine just so ! 
Then when the sky is darkened, 
And I to the fishing must be, 
Even amongst the waves of the ocean 
That woman appears to me ! 

And when returning to the cottage, 
I salute the pretty thing, 
And the usual canzonetta 
Beneath her balcony sing : 
Come, come, thou art the star, 
Thou of Amalfi art the fairy ; 
But the rose is now culled, 
And of loving her I must be chary.

The Neapolitan dialect, in which most of these fishermen's 
and boatmen's songs are written, is so difficult to translate, 
literally and at the same time rhythmically, that the latter 
has many times to be sunk in the endeavour to accomplish 
the former. This song of " The Fairy of Amalfi " may be 
taken as a very fair specimen of the watermen's ditties of 
Italy.

FENESTA VASCIA. 

The song known as the Neapolitan "Water-Carrier's 
Song " may be perhaps deserving of a place in a collection 
of the " Music of the Waters." " The Closed Window," or 
" Fenesta Vascia ": 



ITALIAN VERSION. 
Fenesta vascia, e patrona crudele, 
Quanta sospire m' aje fatto jetare ? 
M' arde sto core comm' a na cannela, 
Bella a quanno te sento annomenare ! 
O je piglia la sperienzia de la neve ! 
La neve e fredda e se fa maniare ; 
E tu comme si tant' aspra e crudele ! 
Muorto mme vide e non mme vuo 
ajutare. 



Vorria asseventare no piccinotto 

Co na lancella a ghire vennenno 

acqua, 

Pe mme nne i da chiste palazzuotte, 
Belle femmene meja, a chi vo acqua ? 
Se vota na nennella da la 'ncoppa : 
Chi e sto ninno che va vennenno 

acqua ? 

E io responno co parole accorte, 
So lagreme d' ammore, e non e acqua ! 



ENGLISH VERSION. 

Closed window ! Ah, cruel mistress, 

How many sighs have you made me 
heave ? 

My heart burns like a candle 

Whenever, sweet, your name they 
breathe ! 

Alas ! ungrateful one, learn from the 
snow, 

Which is tractable though cold ; 

But thou, how severe and cold thou 
art ! 

Were I dying, to save me not suffi- 
ciently bold. 

I wish I could become a pretty lad, 
And with a can go selling water, 
Then under every balcony I'd shout, 
My pretty maids ! who wishes water ? 
So, that perchance, the fairest one 

might ask, 
Who is that youth, who is selling 

water? 

And in a few short words I'd say, 
Tears of love it is, but no, not water !

The pretty idea of this little poem seems almost lost in 
the English version, certes one may translate Neapolitan 
songs into our own cold, stately language ; but the softly- 
rounded phrases sound meaningless and harsh. One cannot 
translate the passionate abandon of the Neapolitan's love- 
songs, nor the sunny impudence of those which treat of 
other matters. We may bring the sprig of Edelweiss from 
the lofty heights of the Alps, and expect it to flourish in a 
back garden in Bloomsbury, and we may sing the Neapo- 
litan song to the piano in our chilly northern land ; but we

cannot put into it all the life, and fire, and sweetness, that 
makes it the thing of beauty it is, when it has the guitar 
for accompaniment, the soft liquid Italian syllables for 
words, and the bright, warm sun and turquoise bay to lend 
it the subtle charm of colour. 



LA CAROLINA. 

" La Carolina " or " Caroline " is a favourite with the' 
Venetian gondoliers, as well as with the boatmen of Naples. 
The verses are so stupid that I feel tempted to suppress 
them, one verse may be perhaps enough to show the 
maudlin sentiment of them : 



ITALIAN VERSION. 

Aggio visto na figliola, 

Bell' assaje e graziosa, 

Tutt' acconcia e vrucculosa, Uh !

chella vocca, 

Quant' e bello chillo riso ! 
Tu te cride mparadiso quanno sta

Quant' e bello chillo viso. Quant' e

Tu te cride mparadiso quanno sta

Allegretto. 



ENGLISH VERSION. 
I a girl have seen, 
Very pretty and very graceful, 
All neatness, and oh ! so kind, 
A piece of sugar she is to my mind ! 
Oh, how sweet is that mouth ! 
Oh, how dear is that smile ! 
Thou wouldst think thyself in Para- 
dise 
Were she near thee but a while !

Perhaps the most extraordinary men that my work 
of collecting the sailors' songs has led me amongst are 
some specimens of Italian seamen who visited me at 
home. I had often found it a difficult matter, and always 
one requiring some little tact, to induce the sailors to accept 
any gratuity for their trouble in singing. Sometimes, in 
the case of their coming to me, all they would deign to 
accept was their railway-fare from the neighbouring port 
where they happened to be staying ; but on the occasion 
of the visit of the before-mentioned Italians the case was 
quite different. One of them, a ferocious, black-browed, 
olive-skinned individual, I had made acquaintance with in 
the Infirmary, where he had been for some weeks owing 
to an accident to his leg. He could speak a little English, 
and after a few inquiries as to his accident, &c., I asked 
him if he could sing ? The answer being satisfactory, I 
then proceeded to question him as to the sailors' songs. 
He appeared to understand me perfectly, and it was 
arranged that he should come and see me and sing some 
of his chanties, as soon as he was able to leave the Infirmary; 
the chaplain, with his usual kindness, volunteered to direct 
him. Weeks passed, and I had almost forgotten him, when 
one afternoon, sitting writing at the open window, I was 
startled by hearing what appeared to be a very violent 
altercation at the front door. Very foreign-sounding 
tongues seemed taking part in the disturbance, and three 
very foreign-looking faces greeted me as I went forward, to 
find the maid vainly endeavouring to understand the reason 
of this strange invasion. I must add that she was a 
stranger, and therefore not accustomed, as she very soon 
became, to the heterogeneous style of visitors who, in the 
persons of the various nationalities of sailors, found their 
way to me. One of the three, my infirmary acquaintance, 



Music OF THE' WATERS. 185 

on catching sight of me, instantly shouted, " Missie ! 
missie ! " and, evidently thinking all difficulties removed by 
this recognition, marched in, followed by two dreadful 
specimens of the most swarthy, oily, evil-looking men I 
ever saw rings through their noses, as well as in their 
ears, adding an unnecessary touch of barbarism to their 
already horrible appearance. As far as I could learn from 
the excited manner and disjointed English of the Italian, 
I gathered that they were Mexicans, but why he had 
brought them, or where he had found them, I could not 
make out They could not speak a word of any language 
that I ever remember having heard before ; I conclude it 
must have been some sort of low Spanish. I tried by 
every means in my power to induce the Italian to sing, but 
with no avail, he utterly refused, without money were first 
given him. I, of course, refused this, and told him he 
should certainly have money after his singing. This did 
not please him, and he, in his turn, tried coaxing, 

" Missie, give me just ten shilling, and me sing long 
time ! " 

"Just ten shillings, and you'll be off like a shot," 
was my thought. " No, no," I said. " Missie give you 
no ten shillings, and if you won't sing now, you may go ; I 
have no time to wait for you to make up your mind any 
longer." 

Just at this moment I became aware of the two Mexi- 
cans nodding sagaciously at each other and touching their 
heads, whilst they stared fixedly at mine, and then shouted 
something in their alarming language at the Italian ; he 
in his turn looked at my head, then laughed. I could stand 
it no longer, and, truth to tell, I was beginning to be 
rather afraid of my visitors, and feeling that I should hail 
their departure with relief. I turned to ask him what all 
these signs and laughing meant, and he told me it was 
only astonishment at my hair not being black. " They 
only arrived this day," he added, " and have always been 
amongst the darkest people in the world." 



186 Music OF THE WATERS. 

To my utter amazement one of the Mexicans here burst 
in with, 

" Ya, ya ! Missie have white hair ! " (my hair being- a 
light brown). 

They all three laughed at this speech ; the suddenness 
of the man's breaking into English when I had supposed 
him utterly ignorant of it prevented me answering, and 
the next minute they surrounded me with more cries for 
money ; this time the Mexicans joining in this " Back- 
sheesh " chorus. They became so uproarious in their 
demands, that I was obliged to ring for some one to help me 
to silence and be rid of them. 

But this, as I before said, was quite an exception ; as a 
rule, I had nothing whatever to complain of in the manners 
of any of my sailor-visitors. Sometimes the quaintest 
remarks and most droll compliments would slip out, and I 
have often had to refrain from smiling at the strangeness of 
attire some of them such, for instance, as the Japanese 
adopted ; doubtless out of compliment to the English 
lady they came to see. I , had often heard of the custom 
of oiling the face amongst semi-barbarous people, but I 
never expected to have this extra addition to the toilette 
made for my benefit, but I have even had that honour, 
and must admit I prefer good wholesome soap and 
water to the greasy compound employed in the ablutions 
of some of my visitors. 

In a volume of the Cornhill Magazine (xlv. 1882) there 
is a charming description of the Venetian boatmen given 
in an article by Mr. J. A. Symonds, entitled " A Gondo- 
lier's Wedding." Mr. Symonds writes as one who is inti- 
mately acquainted with them, and refers several times 
during his account of the wedding festivities to the 
gondoliers' singing " The great business of the evening 
began when the eating was over, and the decanters filled 
with new wine of Mirano circulated freely. . ." Antonio, 
who is a powerful young fellow, with bronzed cheeks and 
a perfect tempest of coal-black hair in flakes upon his 



Music OF THE WATERS. 187 



forehead, has a most extraordinary soprano, sound as a 
bell, strong as a trumpet, well-trained, and true to the 
least shade in intonation. Piero, whose rugged Neptunian 
features, sea-wrinkled, tell of a rough water-life, boasts a 
bass of resonant, almost pathetic quality. Francesco has 
a mezza voce, which might, by a stretch of politeness, be 
called baritone. ..." Then they burst into full singing, 
Antonio leading with a metal note that thrilled one's ears, 
but still was musical. Complicated contrapuntal pieces, 
such as we should call madrigals, with ever reviving refrains 
of'Venezia, gemma 1 Triatica, sposa del mar/ descending 
probably from ancient days, followed each other in quick 
succession. Barcaroles, serenades, love-songs, and invita- 
tions to the water, were interwoven for relief. One of 
these romantic pieces had a beautiful burden, ' Dormi, 
o bella, o fingi di dormir,' of which the melody was fully 
worthy. But the most successful of all the tunes 
were two with a sad motive. The one repeated in- 
cessantly, * Ohime ! Mia madre mori ;.' the other was a 
girl's love-lament, " Perche tradirmi, perche lasciarmi ! 
prima d' amarmi non eri cosi ! ' All these were purely 
popular songs." Mr. Symonds then goes on to speak of 
the passionate love for operas, which exists amongst the 
Venetian watermen. " These operatic reminiscences had 
lost something of their theatrical formality, and assumed 
instead the serious gravity, the quaint movement, and 
marked emphasis which belong to popular music in 
Northern and Central Italy. An antique character was 
communicated even to the recitative of Verdi by slight, 
almost indefinable, changes of rhythm and accent." In 
conclusion, he says, " On all these occasions I have found 
these gondoliers the same sympathetic, industrious, cheery, 
affectionate folk. They live in many respects a hard and 
precarious life. The winter in particular is a time of 
anxiety and sometimes of privation, even to the well-to-do 
among them. Work then is scarce, and what there is, is 
rendered disagreeable to them by the cold. Yet they take

their chance with facile temper, and are not soured by 
hardships. The amenities of the Venetian sea and air, the 
healthiness of the lagoons, the cheerful bustle of the poorer 
quarters, the brilliancy of this southern sunlight, and the 
beauty which is everywhere apparent, must be reckoned as 
important factors in the formation of their character. And 
of that character, as I have said, the final note is playful- 
ness. In spite of difficulties, their life has never been stern 
enough to sadden them. . . . On the other hand, their life 
has never been so lazy as to reduce them to the savagery 
of the traditional Neapolitan lazzaroni. They have had 
to work daily for small earnings, but under favourable 
conditions, and their labour has been lightened by much 
good fellowship among themselves, by the amusements of 
ihehfesfe and their singing clubs." 

The fact of the Venetian boatmen chanting strophes of 
Tasso is mentioned again and again in books treating 
of the life on the lagoons. The gondoliers of Venice 
used to chant' strophes of Tnsso as they skimmed 
in and out of the lagoons ; but that was in the days 
of Venice's historical prime, and the gondolier of the 
nineteenth century has come down to the level of 
other boatmen, and though still associated with all that 
is most romantic and poetical, he is content to ply his 
oars to the same inspiriting strains as his fellow-country- 
men in Naples and elsewhere. 'On St. Mary's Day one 
may hear them chanting the well-known " Sicilian 
Mariners' Hymn " :

This is done in chorus, and very solemn it sounds, in 
the still, early morning, before the lazy stir, that is all 
Venice now knows of bustle, commences. 

Perhaps of all strange water ceremonies the world has 
ever known, the strangest is (or rather was, for the year 
1797 was the last in which it took place), that of the 
Doge of Venice marrying the Adriatic annually on As- 
cension Day, by dropping into it a ring from his bucentaur, 
or state barge, attended by all the nobility and ambas- 
sadors in gondolas. 

The gondoliers improvise all kinds of songs on well- 
known arias and themes, to suit themselves. " One poor 
little creature," Mr. Chorley in his volume on " National 
Music " speaks of, " who was old enough to have seen 
something of better days in Venice, used to solace 
himself by piping out as he sculled along, or sat 
waiting on his steps for the passengers who so rarely

patronized him, a legend of the Virgin, which seemed to 
have no beginning or end, to a slow version of the valse 
movement closing the lovely concerted piece, 'O Guar- 
date,' from Rossini's ' Turco in Italia/ Many accidental 
sharps and flats were added to this, probably resulting from 
his extreme age and hunger ; but, nevertheless, the mono- 
tonous repetition of this travestied melody seemed to 
afford him much comfort." 

Byron in " Childe Harold's Pilgrimage " says : 

" In Venice, Tasso's echoes are no more ;" 

and in a note on this line in an early edition of Mr. Murray's, 
the following occurs : " The well-known song of gondoliers, 
of alternate stanzas from Tasso's 'Jerusalem/ has died with 
the independence of Venice. Editions of the poem, with 
the original on one column, and the Venetian variation on 
the other, as sung by the boatmen, were once common, and 
are still to be found ; the following extract will serve to 
show the difference between the Tuscan epic and the 
Canta alia Barcariola : 



THE ORIGINAL. 

Canto 1' arme pietose, e '1 capitano 
Che '1 gran Sepolcro libero di Christo, 
Molto edi opro col senno, e con la 

mano, 

Molto soffri nel glorioso acquisto; 
E in van T Inferno a lui s' oppose, e 

in vano 
L' Arno d' Asia, edi Libia il popol 

i Santi, 
Segni ridusse i suoi compagni erranti.

Some of the elder gondoliers will, however, take *up and 
continue a stanza of their once familiar bard." 

Lord Byron and another Englishman rowed once to the 
Lido ; in the boat they had two singers, one a carpenter, 
the other a gondolier. They sang " The Death of Clorinda," 
and " The Palace of Armida," in Tuscan verse. The car- 
penter knew three hundred stanzas, and had a voice of 



Music OF THE WATERS. 191 

most extraordinary power ; the gondolier assisted his already 
too shrill voice, by holding his hand to one side of his 
mouth. From the description, which is rather too lengthy 
to quote entirely, I should gather that this expedition and 
its vocal experiences were not entirely such as to arouse 
the admiration of the poet and his friend, although some 
water-songs heard during the time he spent in Venice 
must have charmed Byron into writing, 

" There be none of Beauty's daughters 

With a magic like thee ; 
And like music on the waters 
Is thy sweet voice to me." 

Although Tasso is no longer heard, there is yet much 
music on the canals, and strangers often think the songs 
are still verses of Tasso. In the days when these were 
popular, two boatmen sang the strophes in turn, sometimes 
at a great distance ; for instance, a gondolier would begin a 
strophe of "Ariosto" to Rousseau's melody, a second gondo- 
lier would then take it up, and so on. Sometimes the night, 
through many a weary hour of waiting, was thus spent by 
the Venetian boatmen. A writer in the " Curiosities of 
Literature," speaking of their singing, says : " The sleepy 
canals, the lofty buildings, the splendour of the moon, the 
deep shadows of the few gondolas that moved like spirits 
hither and thither, increased the striking peculiarity of the 
scene ; and amidst all these circumstances it was easy to 
confess the character of this wonderful harmony." In this 
same book I read, that the fishermen's wives of the Lido 
spent their evenings sitting along the shore, while their 
husbands fished, singing stanzas from Tasso and other 
popular songs at the pitch of their voices, going on till 
each one could distinguish the responses of her own hus- 
band in the distance : a very pretty idea truly, but one I 
should fancy which would have to borrow all its enchant- 
ment, for the listener, from the necessary distance. It 
would scarcely prove a peaceful walk "by the sad sea 



192 Music OF THE WATERS. 

waves," if those waves echoed with every rise and fall the 
shrill voices of Italian women at their highest pitch. 

Amongst the Venetian maidens, as amongst the Highland 
clans of Scotland, a sailor's calling is amongst those which 
are looked upon suspiciously. 

" Sailor's trade at sea to die ! " 
and again, 

" I want no fisher with a fishy smell, 
A market-gardener would not suit me well, 
Nor yet a mariner who sails the sea ; 
A fine flour-merchant is the man for me." 

By which it will be seen that this last singer's evident 
ideal is a corn-merchant for a husband rather an exalted 
lot for a Venetian maid of the people. Fishermen are con- 
sidered poor, penniless folk, and she who weds a sailor does 
so at her own peril. 

" L' amour del manner no dura un' ora, 
La dove che lu el va, lu s' inamora." 

And even if the sailor's troth can be trusted, is it not his 
trade " At sea to die"? But the young girl will not be 
persuaded. " All say to me, * Beauty, do not take the 
mariner, for he will make thee die ;' if he make me die, 
so it must be : I will wed him, for he is my soul." So the 
gondolier's Marietta is as true to him in her heart of hearts 
as Poll or Nancy to her Jack. The following is a verse 
from a Venetian bead-stringer's song : 

" My love is far and far away from me, 
I am at home, and he has gone to sea ; 
He is at sea, and he has sails to spread, 
I am at home, and I have beads to thread." 

The gondolier's love, though, can afford to sing in a 
lighter strain, there is not the shadow of interminable voy- 
ages upon her. " I go out on the balcony ; I see Venice, 



Music OF THE WATERS. 193 

and I see my joy, who starts. I go out on the balcony ; I 
see the sea, and I see my love, who rows." 

There is a lovely little song well-known in Venice, " Song 
of a Mariner," which combines with the exquisite simplicity 
of the Tuscan the glow and fervour so characteristic of the 
Venetian ; though I must admit a glow and fervour which 
are born of the ever egotistical nature of their songs, and 
in which a blending of the Tuscan humility and sweetness 
would be an additional charm. Was it not Dante who so 
grieved for the character of these lyrics, and who spoke so 
contemptuously of the vulgarity of the language they were 
written in, as " The Jargon of the Lagunes " ? 

SONG OF A MARINER. 

" Fair art thou born, but love is not for me, 
A sailor's calling sends me forth to sea. 
I do desire to paint thee on my sail, 
And o'er the briny deep I'd carry thee ; 
They ask, what ensign ? when the boat they hail. 
For woman's love, I bear this effigy, 
For woman's love, for love of maiden fair ; 
If her I may not love, I love forswear ! " 

Probably the author of these picturesque and most truly 
nautical words was some Istriot fisherman, though but 
little credit is given to seafaring men in Italy for being 
poetical, and Dr. Pitre remarks that, " Sailors pick up 
foreign songs in their voyages, chiefly English and Ameri- 
can, and come home inclined to look down upon the songs 
of their native land." Dr. Pitre perhaps does not know the 
contagious vigour of a good British hauling chanty, or 
has not been moved by the pathos of a score or more faith- 
ful sailor-husbands, trying to make the time pass in the 
far-away tropics with " Home, Dearie Home." 

The story of a damsel who dropped a ring in the sea, 
and owed its rescue to a fisherman, who for sole reward 

O 



194 Music OF THE WATERS. 

demanded a kiss, is well-known on the Adriatic and Medi- 
terranean coasts 

" Oh ! pescator dell' onda 

Findeliu, 

Vieni pescar in qua ! 
Colla bella sua barca, 
Colla bella se ne va 
Findeliu ! liu ! la ! " 

The charm of a gondolier's early morning cargo Is well 
described in the following verse. All lovers and habitues of 
the City of Doges are familiar with the sight of the gondolas 
coming into Venice, in the early mornings, laden with fresh 
fruit and flowers. 

" To-night their boats must seek the sea, 

One night his boat will linger yet ; 
They bear a freight of wood, and he 
A freight of rose and violet." 

Amongst the curious articles on folk-lore which ap- 
peared in the pages of The Gentleman's Magazine, there 
is a very graphic account given in one of the ceremony 
known as " Wedding the Adriatic " on Ascension Day. 
It says, " The most ridiculous, though perhaps the most 
pompous show in the world, is that of the annual ceremony 
of the Doge's marrying the sea. It is said to have taken 
its rise from a grant of Pope Alexander III., who, as a 
reward for the zeal of the inhabitants in his restoration to 
the Papal chair, gave them power over the Adriatic, 
as a man hath power over his wife ; in memory of which 
the chief magistrate annually throws a ring into it, with 
these words : ( Desponsamus te, mare, in signum perpetui 
dominii ' (' We espouse thee, O sea, in testimony of our 
perpetual dominion over thee ')." 

Of the many authors who have given to the world their 
impressions of Venice and the Venetians, there is not one 
who has more truthfully and poetically (for they may be 
combined) represented them than Mr. Horatio F. Brown in 



Music OF THE WATERS. 195 

his " Life on the Lagoons." His book inscribed by the 
way to his gondolier "Antonio Salin, my constant com- 
panion in Venice and Venetia " has the salt and the free- 
dom of the grey lagoon, and the light and shade, and 
laughter and tears of those whose life is passed on it, in all 
its pages. Long after I had laid it down, I was haunted by 
the visions it had conjured up for me visions of Chioggian 
market-boats jostling each other ; of bronzed Chiozzotti 
with their pipes between their teeth, reposing on top of their 
cabbage-piles ; of an evening breeze springing up behind, 
and sail and prow being set for Venice, across the pearly- 
grey lagoon ; I could hear the clash and the clamour of the 
evening bells, the splash of the oars, could see the piazza 
lights and the sunset glow, feel the clear pungent odour 
of the lagoons, "the breath of Venice," and the thrilling 
voice of the sea with its ceaseless strain, " II mare mi 
chiama." Mr. Brown, in his inimitable fashion, analyzes 
the great charm of the " Queen of the Adriatic ;" he says, 
" It is the people and the place, the union and interpene- 
tration of the two, the sea-life of these dwellers in the city 
that is always 'just putting out to sea/ which constitutes 
for many the peculiar and enduring charm of Venice. The 
people and the place, so intimately intermingled through 
all their long history, have grown into a single life charged 
with the richness of sea-nature and the warmth of human 
emotion. From both together escapes this essence or soul 
of Venice which we would clasp with all the ardour of a 
lover. Venice, her lagoons, her seafaring folk, become 
the object of a passionate idolatry, which admits no other 
allegiance in the hearts that have known its power. To 
leave her is a sure regret, to return a certain joy. 

" Farewell they may not who say farewell." 

A few words as to the origin of the word " gondola " 
may not be out of place in a chapter bearing on the Vene- 
tian boatmen : again quoting the author of the " Life on 
the Lagoons." " The derivation of the name is still an open 

O 2 



196 Music OF THE WATERS. 

question. But the view which has obtained most general 
acceptance is that which connects the word with the Latin 
Cymba and the Greek KV/JL^ the light boat in which 
Charon ferried souls across the Styx. Charon's boat, as 
it is represented on gems and marbles, resembles the bar- 
chettct) and Charon himself uses a paddle to guide his boat 
behind. To this day, the passenger across a Venetian 
ferry, lays his obol on the gunwale of the gondola, much 
as Charon's ghostly fares were wont to do. On a moon- 
less silent night the waters of the Grand Canal are no 
mean counterfeit of that nether-world river, Lethe, the 
waters of oblivion." * 

The gondoliers are a deeply conservative race. Custom 
is their true religion in its ordinary sense it is an affair of 
the women church-going amongst them has now almost 
ceased to be a habit. Amongst the fishermen and sailors 
of the trading-ships, the case is different. Each boat has its 
patron saint somewhere on its bows, many with a prayer 
painted beneath ; and in the captain's cabin you are sure 
to find a picture of the Madonna wreathed with offerings 
of olive-branches, lemons, and Indian corn : a small light 
in a glass globe usually burns before this little shrine. The 
captain of a trading-boat on its way out to sea would 
hardly pass the little chapels which are built here and 
there on the great piles, without repeating a "Salve 
Regina " or a " Pater Noster," as he stands bare-headed in 
the wind. 

The fishermen of Chioggia as they row home on a 
summer night while away the time, as the gondoliers pass 
theirs in song, with endless tales of Angelica and Orlando, 
Astolfo and Ruggiero, and all the pageantry of the Caro- 
lingian myth, and the Reali di Francia. 

The stars are to the Venetians bei segreti (beautiful 
secrets) ; the pole star is the type of constancy and the 
sailors' hope.

With dough's lovely poem, than which no more 
realistic description of the gondola exists, I close my 
remarks on the Italian watermen : 

IN A GONDOLA ON THE GRAND CANAL, 

VENICE. 

" Afloat ; we move delicious ! Ah, 
What else is like the gondola ? 
This level floor of liquid glass 
Begins beneath us swift to pass, 
It goes as though it went alone 
By some impulsion of its own. 

How light it moves, how softly ! Ah, 
Were all things like the gondola J 

" How light it moves, how softly ! Ah, 
Could life as does our gondola,. 
Unvexed with quarrels, aims, and cares, 
And moral duties and affairs, 
Unswaying, noiseless, swift, and strong, 
For ever thus thus glide along ! 

How light we move, how softly I Ah, 

Were life but as the gondola. 

" With no more motion than should bear 
A freshness to the languid air ; 
With no more effort than expressed 
The need and naturalness of rest, 
Which we beneath a grateful shade 
Should take on peaceful pillows laid ! 

How light we move, how softly ! Ah, 
Were life but as the gondola 1 



Music OF THE WATERS. 199 

" In one unbroken passage borne 
To closing night from opening morn, 
Uplift at whiles slow eyes to mark 
Some palace front, some passing bark ; 
Through windows catch the varying shore, 
And hear the soft turns of the oar ! 

How light we move, how softly ! Ah, 

Were life but as the gondola ! " 



SCANDINAVIAN SEA-SONGS. 



SWEDEN, NORWAY, AND DENMARK. 

" With grand Sea-Songs upon the soul 
Roll'd melody on melody." 

THOSE who have not carefully studied the complex 
character of our English nationality are perhaps not aware 
how much we are indebted to the Scandinavian people ; it 
is well known the Celts were the earliest ascertained 
people on the land, but I do not think that many have 
duly considered that the various manly qualities which we 
pride ourselves upon, have been inherited from that race 
which is known to us as the "hardy Norsemen." Mr.Chorley, 
in his " National Music," gives his impressions of that of 
the North in such wonderfully beautiful language, that I 
think I cannot do better than quote him as an introduc- 
tion ; he says : " In lands of mists and mountains, of long 
winters and short precious summers, the influences of 
scenery are more clearly to be discerned than in regions 
where Nature is uniformly favourable. Gay or grave, the 
music of the North is fresh ; the sad is seldom blended 
with languor ; the sweet has ever something in it to brace, 
even in minor keys, which predominate." 

The Northern sea-songs are grand and stirring melodies, 
rarely if ever tinged with sadness ; the spirit that animated 
the sea-kings of old seems to have been handed down to 
their marine descendants of to-day. Some of the super- 
stition that was ever characteristic of Northern seafaring 



204 Music OF THE WATERS. 

people is still left, and in the far North it is as great as 
ever. Among the Kvans, one curious old woman, Anna 
by name, always spat and turned to the sea, mumbling 
some words as a charm against mermen whenever a boat 
came in. In her charms the word "Jumala" was often 
used ; it is the name of the old god of the Bjarmers, 
whose worship in the far North is not so abolished as 
might be supposed. Dedicated to his cultus, high up in 
the mountains in Finmark, are two altars, from which it 
would appear even in civilized Europe, among the more 
ignorant, Christianityis made to shake handswith Paganism. 
The mermen of the north of Norway were not of the same 
species as the traditionary mermaids of our nursery rhymes, 
" Human above and fishy below," but had legs and feet 
like ordinary mortals ; they were, in fact, a sort of ocean 
giant, always injuring in some way the poor Norse 
sailors. 

The Swedes are eminently a musical people. One of 
their old sea laws, according to Chorley, was that the 
man on the watch should sing a hymn every night. 
Surely there is something very picturesque as well as 
devout in such an ordinance. 

Mr. Ballantyne, in his " Norsemen in the West," puts the 
following song into Karlesefin's mouth. Karlesefin was the 
skipper of the ship that set out for Vinland about 986 ; 
he was himself a skald or poet, although he had no pre- 
tension to great attainments in that way. Seated beside 
the helm guiding the ship, he would interest the group of 
friends who stood, sat, or reclined on the deck and against 
the bulwarks of the high poop, with Sagas descriptive of 
the battles and adventures of their Viking forefathers. One 
can imagine the little party thus occupied on a fine moon- 
light night, a soft wind carrying them pleasantly over the 
rippling sea, and the skipper's voice singing probably in 
some weird monotonous tone the following : 

" Where western waves were all unknown 
And western fields were all unsown, 



Music OF THE WATERS. 205 

When Iceland was the outmost bound 

That roving Viking keels had found, 

Gunbiorn then Ulf Kraka's son 

Still farther west was forced to run 

By furious gales, and there saw land 

Stretching abroad on either hand. 

Eric, of Iceland, called the Red, 

Heard of the news and straightway said, 

1 This western land I'll go and see ; 

Three summers hence look out for me.' 

He went, he landed, stayed awhile, 

And wintered first on Eric's Isle, 

Then searched the coast both far and wide, 

Then back to Iceland o j er the tide. 

1 A wondrous land is this/ he said, 

And called it Greenland of the Sea. 

Twenty-and-five great ships sailed west 

To claim this gem on ocean's breast ; 

With man and woman, horn and hoof, 

And begging for the homestead roof, 

Some turned back in heart but mice 

Some sank amid the northern ice ; 

Half reached the land in much distress, 

At Ericsford and Herulfness. 

Next Biarne Herulf s doughty son 

Sought to trace out the aged one (his father^; 

From Norway sailed, but missed his mark, 

Passed snow-topped Greenland in the dark : 

And then came to a New Found land 

But did not touch the tempting strand, 

For winter winds oppressed him sore, 

And kept him from his father's shore. 

Then Leif the son of Eric rose 

And straightway off to Biarne goes, 

Buys up his ship, takes all his men, 

Fares forth to seek that land again. 

Leif found the land, discovered more, 

And spent a winter on the shore, 



206 Music OF THE WATERS. 

Cut trees and grain to load the ship 

And pay them for the lengthened trip ; 

Named ' Hella-land ' and ' Mark-land ' too, 

And saw an island sweet with dew ! 

And grapes with great abundance found, 

So named it Vinland all around, 

But after that forsook the shore 

And north again for Greenland bore. 

And now we cross the moonlit seas 

To search this land of grapes and trees ; 

Biarne, Thorward, Karlsefin 

Go forth this better land to win, 

With men and cattle not a few, 

And household gear and weapons too : 

And, best of all, with women dear 

To comfort, counsel, check, and cheer. 

Thus far we've made a prosperous way, 

God speed us onward every day ! " 

It was unanimously agreed that this was a true account 
of the discovery of Vinland (America), and of their own 
expedition as far as it had gone ; but one of the party, 
Biarne, insisted that the skipper had not done full justice 
to the subject of the latter, in omitting to mention a whale 
which had dived under the vessel, and substituted the 
following lines : 

"When Biarne, Thorward, Karlsefin 
This famous voyage did begin, 
They stood upon the deck one night 
And there beheld a moving sight : 
It made the very men grow pale, 
Their shudder almost rent the sail ! 
For lo ! they saw a mighty whale. 
It drew a shriek from Olaf brave, 
Then plunged beneath the briny wave, 
And while the women loudly shouted, 
Up came its blundering nose and spouted ; 



Music OF THE WATERS. 207 

Then underneath our keel it went 
And glared with savage fury pent, 
And round about the ship it swum, 
Striking each man and woman dumb. 
Stay one there was who found a tongue, 
And still retained her strength of lung 
Fredessa, beauteous matron bold, 
Resolved to give that whale a scold ! 
But little cared that monster fish 
To gratify Fredessa's wish ; 
He shook his tail, that naughty whale, 
And flourished it like any flail, 
And ho ! for Vinland he made sail ! " 

Mr. Ballantyne further tells us that Biarne is not a 
poet of very high standing ; at least, one may judge from 
the rhyming of the two lines following, that he knew 
how to avail himself of one of the many privileges poets 
have, viz. to take out his licence : 

" And round about the ship it swum, 
Striking each man and woman dumb ! " 

In the same book, "The Norsemen in the West," we 
find another sea-song, which is set to a rattling tune : 

THE DANISH KINGS. 

Solo. " One night when one o' the Irish kings 

Was sleeping in his bed, 
Six Danish kings so Sigvat sings 

Came an' cut off his head. 
The Irish boys they heard the noise, 

And flocked unto the shore ; 
They caught the kings, and put out their eyes, 

And left them in their gore. 

Chorus. Oh ! this is the way we served the kings 

An' spoiled their pleasure the dirty things 
When they came to harry and flap their wings 



208 Music OF THE WATERS. 

Upon the Irish shore ore, 
Upon the Irish shore. 

Solo. Next year the Danes took terrible pains 

To wipe that stain away ; 
They came with a fleet their foes to meet 

Across the stormy say. 
Each Irish carl great stones did hurl 

In such a mighty rain, 
The Danes went down with a horrible stoun, 

An' never came up again. 

Chorus. Oh ! this is the way," &c. 

In Mr. Samuel Laing's admirable translation of Snorro 
Sturleson's " Heimskringla " (Chronicle of the Kings of 
Norway), there are many famous sea-songs ; indeed, the 
volumes are so interspersed with them that it would be 
a difficult matter to make a selection from so inexhaustible 
a mine. Many of the same expressions and even senti- 
ments that may be found in the modern sailor's songs are 
introduced in these old Icelandic Sagas ; for instance, in 
the following : 

" The hero who knows well to ride 
The sea-horse o'er the foaming tide ; 
He who in boyhood wild rode o'er 
The seaman's horse to Scandia's shore, 
And showed the Danes his galley's bow, 
Right nobly scours the ocean now." 

The expression sea-horse (or sometimes ocean-steed) is 
commonly used for a ship, probably from many having 
had the figure-head of a horse on the bow. Mr. Laing 
seems to rate Snorro Sturleson's powers as a dramatic his- 
torian very highly, ranking him with Carlyle, Scott, and 
even with Shakespeare himself, and placing him very far 
above Joinville or Froissart. Therefore, we may venture 
to regard as authentic his account of the half-fabulous 
tales of the time of Odin, though it must, I think, be a

somewhat difficult matter to discriminate between the 
mythological and historical, so closely are they blended 
in the narratives of the Northern countries. 

There is a curious tale about herrings mentioned in 
one, Saga Eyvind. Skaldespiller, a poet, composed a 
poem about the people of Iceland, for which they re- 
warded him by each peasant giving him three silver 
pennies of full weight. These pennies were purified and 
made into a row of silver clasps, and valued at fifty marks 
Eyvind on receiving these clasps (which, by the way> 
resembled the rows of buttons still used by the Friesland 
fishermen for ornaments on their jackets), was obliged to 
separate them and sell them to defray his household 
expenses ; a proceeding which must have seemed the 
reverse of dignified. But the same spring a shoal of 
herrings set in upon the fishing-ground beyond the coast- 
side, and Eyvind manned a ship's boat with his house- 
servants and cotters, and rode to where the herrings were 
come, singing : 

" Now let the steed of ocean bound 
O'er the North Sea with dashing sound ; 
Let nimble bird and screaming gull 
Fly round and round, our net is full. 
Fain would I know if fortune sends 
A like provision to my friends. 
Welcome provision, it is, I wot, 
That the whale drives to our cook's pot." 

So entirely were his movable goods exhausted that he was 
obliged to sell his arrows to buy herrings, or other meat for 
his table : 

" Our arms and ornaments of gold 
To buy us food we gladly sold ; 
The arrows of the bow gave we 
For the bright arrows of the sea." 

Herrings, from their swift darting along, are called the 

p 



210 Music OF THE WATERS. 



arrows of the sea ; and there is a play upon the words " pil " 
(arrows) and " sild " (herrings), as being somewhat similar 
in sound in the original translation. 

In the reign of King Magnus the Good (1035 1047) there 
appears to have been a great deal of fighting, and most of 
the songs of that period tell of battles by sea and land ; 
some few lament the hardships of sea-life, such as 

" No drink but the salt sea 
On board our ships had we, 
When, following our king, 
On board our ships we spring. 
Hard work on the salt sea, 
Off Scandia's coast, had we ; 
But we laboured for the king, 
To his foemen death to bring." 

But most of these are stirring battle-songs : 

" Brave Magnus, from the stern springing 
On to the stem, where swords were ringing, 
From his sea-raven's beak of gold 
Deals death around the brave ! the bold ! 

'Twas on a Sunday morning bright, 
Fell out this great and bloody fight, 
When men were arming, fighting, dying, 
Or on the red decks wounded lying. 
And many a man foredoomed to die, 
To save his life o'erboard did fly, 
But sank ; for swimming could not save, 
And dead men rolled in every wave." 

There seems to have been an origin for the well-known 
song, most familiar, perhaps, to children, of " London Bridge 
is broken down/' in the reign of King Olaf. Speaking of 
the invasion of England in the time of Ethelred, Mr. Laing 
says : " The Danes who had already been settled in 
England some time King Ethelred having gone to France 
had raised a great work, a bulwark of stone, timber, and 



Music OF THE WATERS. 211 

turf, where they had stationed an army. This was at 
Southwark, or, as they called it, Sudrviki, and between 
this and the castle (probably the site of the Tower of 
London) there was a bridge so broad that two waggons 
could pass each other upon it ; on this were raised barri- 
cades, both towers and wooden parapets, in the direction 
of the river namely, across the bridge which were almost 
breast high ; and under the bridge were piles driven into 
the bottom of the river. King Ethelred, on hearing of the 
death of King Swend, the Danish king, came home imme- 
diately, and soon gathered an immense force about him, 
amongst whom were King Olaf and a troop of Northmen. 
They tried to get possession of the bridge, but the Danes 
firmly defended it. A council was called together to deter- 
mine how they should get the bridge broken down, and it 
was determined to lay their forces under the bridge. King 
Olaf ordered great platforms of floating wood to be tied 
together with hazel bands, and for this he took down 
old houses, and with these as a roof he covered over his 
ships so widely that it reached over their sides. Under 
this screen he set pillars so high and stout, that there both 
was room for swinging their swords, and the roofs were 
strong enough to withstand the stones cast down upon 
them. They rowed up the river when ready, but when 
they came near the bridge, there were cast down upon 
them so many stones and missile weapons, such as arrows 
and spears, that neither helmet nor shield could hold 
out against' them ; and the ships themselves were so 
greatly damaged, that many retreated. But King Olaf 
and his men rowed quite up under the bridge, laid their 
cables around the piles which supported it, and then rowed 
off as fast as they could. The piles thus shaken were 
loosened under the bridge, and as the armed troops of the 
Danish stood thick upon it, together with heaps of stones 
and other weapons, the piles being loosened and broken, 
the bridge gave way, and a great part of the men fell into 
the Thames ; the rest fled, some into the castle, and some 

P 2

into Southwark. Thereafter Southwark was stormed and 
taken. Now when the people in the castle saw that the 
river was mastered, and that they could not hinder the 
passage of ships up into the country, they became afraid, 
surrendered the Tower, and took Ethelred to be their 
king." 




" London Bridge is broken down, 
Gold is won, and bright renown. 

Shields resounding, 

War-horns sounding, 
Hildur shouting in the din ! 

Arrows singing, 

Mail-coats ringing 
Odin makes our Olaf win ! 

" King Ethelred has found a friend, 
Brave Olaf will his throne defend 

In bloody fight 

Maintain his right, 

Win back his land 

With blood-red hand, 

And Edmund's son upon his throne replace 
Edmund, the star of every royal race ! 

" At London Bridge stout Olaf gave 
Odin's law to his war-men brave 
( To win or die ! ' 
And their foemen fly : 
Some by the dyke-side refuge gain, 
Some in their tents on Southwark plain. 
This sixth attack 
Brought victory back." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 213 



There is a Laplander's song by Sigurd, relative to their 
making boats, given also by Mr. Laing : 

" In the Lapland tent 
Brave days we spent, 
Under the grey birch-tree ; 
In bed or on bank, 
We knew no rank, 
And a merry crew were we. 

" Good ale went round 
As we sat on the ground, 
Under the grey birch-tree ; 
And up with the smoke 
Flew laugh and joke, 
And a merry crew were we." 

These boats were so light that no ship could overtake them 
in the water, according to what was sung at the time : 

" Our skin-sewed Fin-boats lightly swim, 
Over the sea like wind they skim. 
Our ships are built without a nail ; 
Few ships like ours can row or sail." 

The following is from the pen of King Harald : 

" While wives of husbands fondly dream, 
Here let us anchor in the stream, 
In Godnarfiord ; we'll safely moor 
Our sea-homes, and sleep quite secure." 

There is no nation in the world prouder of its national 
ensign than is Denmark of its Dann<brog not even 
England of her Union Jack. Of this Dannebrog there is 
a curious legend, or rather, I should say, history. During 
the Valdemarian period the Danes now turned propagan- 
dists of Christianity, and during the war they waged against 
the pagan countries on the south and east of the Baltic, in 
one of the battles fought near Reval, in Russia, in the year 
1219, a great miracle is said to have occurred. They had 



214 Music OF THE WATERS. 



discarded the old pagan flag of the raven, a new one was 
vouchsafed them by Heaven and sent down to them 
under this they became victorious. It was a red flag with 
a white cross, still the national ensign by sea and land. 

Amongst the Danish national songs there is one com- 
memorative of this : 

" The Danndbrog, 'tis known, 
The Dannebrog, 'tis known, 
It fell from Heaven down ; 
Yes, it fell from Heaven down ! 
It floats upon the mast, 
The soldier grasps it fast. 
And no flag in the world besides, like ours, 
From Heaven was ever cast." 

Danish poetry lacks the polish of southern national 
song, both as to rhyme and rhythm. Indeed, it recalls 
the times of our own Chaucer and Gower. It is rough and 
romantic, and not at all wanting in vigour and expressive- 
ness. Perhaps climate regulates poesy as it does the human 
constitution. All Scandinavian national songs abound in 
reiterations. 

The Vikings (sea-rovers or pirates), who played so im- 
portant a part during the Danish conquests, were not 
Vi-kings, but Vik-kings (Veekings), so called, says Mr. 
Worsaae in his account of the Danes and Norwegians, 
either from the Icelandic Vik (Danish Vig) y a bay of the 
sea, or from Vig, battle or slaughter. The latter, I fancy, 
seems the more probable ; although many may place more 
reliance on Mr. Worsaae's first solution. There is much 
that remains shrouded in obscurity concerning these 
northern lands, and there is a terse saying very appropriate 
to Scandinavian researches : 

" What is hits is histories, 
What is missed is mysteries." 

The Danish people are not musical when compared with 



Music OF THE WATERS. 215 



such harmony-loving countries as Germany, France, Italy, 
and Sweden. Their sailors have but few songs, and those 
are certainly not to be classed under the heading of 
chanties. 

The capstan song for the Danish Navy is, " Come, all ye 
jolly sailors bold " : 

Solo. " Come, all ye jolly sailors bold, 
Chorus. Heave and go, my Nancy O ! 

Solo. Listen till my tale is told, 
Chorus. Heave and go, my Nancy O ! 

Solo. The king trusts to his sailors bold, 
And we shall find them as of old 
For father, mother, sisters, wives, 
We're ready now to risk our lives. 
For Danish girls, with eyes so blue, 
We'll do all that can sailors do. 
And Dannebrog upon our masts 
Shall float as long as this world lasts ; 
And now for our brave captain, we, 
Will give three cheers right heartily. 

Solo. Then up, mates, up, and blaze away, 
Chorus. Heave and go, my Nancy O ! 

Solo. Listen till my tale is told, 
Chorus. Heave and go, my Nancy O ! " 

Modern Scandinavian " chanties " resemble our English 
ones very closely, many words being exactly the same ; 
they are spirited tunes, characteristic of the fresh, hardy, 
brisk men who sing them. They have their capstan songs, 
their hauling " chanties," their outward and homeward- 
bound songs, and those of forecastle fame, descriptive of 
sailor's and sea life, and illustrative of their grand old Viking 
fathers. The following are both recognized forecastle 
favourites :

To this last capstan tune no words were sent me. Some 
of the songs furnished with verses are of very little use, save 
to those who are acquainted with the Norwegian language 
as sung by the sailors ; it is almost impossible to make 
any correct translation of the words. They mean but 
little to the singers of them, that is, judging them from a 
sensible point of view ; but they mean decidedly less 
to us, who are not Norwegian. It has often struck 
me that there must be a very forcible freemasonry 
between sailors of all nations with regard to their language, 
even putting aside those technical terms which hold good 
all the world over, and which enables the Norwegian to 
understand as readily as the Italian, with whom they 
originate, the words " starboard " and " larboard," when 
the Dutchman and Englishman, the Frenchman and 
Russian exchange glances of sympathy over some thrilling 
yarn told in the strange forecastle vernacular of an 
English vessel.

The song for Jonas Anton Hjelm is a well-known one 
on board Norwegian vessels, and though perhaps not 
known as any particular sort of working song, it is yet as 
often heard as any. " Hurrah for Jonas Anton Hjelm," and 
" Sing, saylor, hurra, my boy," seem to suggest that it is 
commemorative of some evidently noteworthy personage 
Jonas Anton Hjelm by name.

A translation of the foregoing seems scarcely necessary,

A song used when throwing ballast is the next one I 
give, and perhaps among all the songs I have heard sung by 
the blue-jackets of the world there is none so redolent of the 
freshness and vigour of the sea as this Norwegian chanty. 
I could understand any land-sick lad longing for a sea- 
life if he once heard this ballast-throwing song ringing 
from the decks of some Norwegian vessel ; it has a swing 
and " go" about it that are most captivating :

In a letter I received from an English author who writes 
of the sea and sailors, he says that there are not many sea- 
songs in vogue in Northern Europe, and that almost all the 
<l chanties" that belong to our seamen are of Spanish 
origin. Amongst the hundreds of letters I have had from 
different parts of the world on the subject of the sailors' 
songs, there is not one that so emphatically contradicts my 
experience in collecting them. Thanks to the very kind 
and unwearying assistance of Mr. Conradi, the Scandi- 
navian Consul for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, I have been able to 
procure more specimens of genuine "chanties" than perhaps 
have been found amongst any other nation, and I fear I

must add that it is due to the evident inability or disin- 
clination of those members of the Spanish community 
whom I have addressed in the matter that I have not been 
favoured with any information or even replies to my in- 
quiries, that I cannot include amongst the accounts of the 
" Sailors' Songs of all Nations " a chapter devoted to those 
of the country whose maritime importance once took 
precedence of all other. 

I cannot close my remarks on the Scandinavian sea-songs 
without a regret, although one that is not occasioned by 
the kindly people of those Northern lands, rather, I must 
acknowledge the pleasure the task of collecting their songs 
has afforded me, encouraged and aided as I have been in 
the undertaking, but only regretting that anything com- 
memorative of so noble a country should be so imperfectly 
done. 



GERMAN SAILORS' SONGS. 



** The fiddler in his tavern, 
The long-drawn sailor-song." 



Crown the deck the festive sailors 
Of the broad and German Rhine. 

Der Rhein ! Der Rhein ! 

I know the song, the jovial singers too, I know." 



GERMAN SAILORS' SONGS. 

" Liebchen, Ade ! 
Scheiden thut Weh. 
Morgen geht's in die wogende See." 

THERE are in North Germany, according to the late 
Captain Goodenough, about 80,000 seafaring men. As a 
characteristic, most of the German ships are manned by 
entirely German crews, perhaps mixed now and then with 
a few Scandinavians and Dutch. Frequently German ships 
in foreign ports make up their number by men sent from 
home, as every able-bodied man in Germany has to serve 
three years either in the army or navy. The seafaring 
population receive a good training, and it is on account of 
their discipline and sobriety that German sailors frequently 
are employed in foreign ships. There are, of course, cases 
of desertion, but hardly as many as in other countries, as in 
most of them the German Consuls have the power to im- 
prison deserting sailors. Frequently hard-earned money 
may also be squandered in a reckless way, but on the whole 
the German seaman must be called thrifty. The German 
sailors being almost entirely drawn from the coasts of the 
Baltic and the North Sea, most of their songs are in the 
North German dialect, and as such rather difficult to 
translate. 

To the well-known tune of " In Berlin sagt' Er," the 
following truly sailor-like verses are sung : 



GERMAN VERSION. 

Juche, lustig, seggt he, 
Ich bin Kock, seggt he. 
Drink recht geern, seggt he, 
En Glas Grogh, seggt he.

Siinst et makt. Always do. 



IN BERLIN SAGT ER. 



Allegretto. 




Like most of the German sailors' songs, this one is 
written in Low German. It is not easy to render quite 
accurately or rhythmically in English the peculiarities of 
this droll piece. It is supposed to be sung by one voice, 
save the inevitable "says he," at the end of each line, 
which is given by the whole company present. The 
Germans have no organized set of chanties, belonging to 
their different kinds of work, as our men have on board 
ship. Their songs are mostly, like " The Jolly Cook," set 
to some well-known popular tune, though the words are 
often as sailor-like as any I have come across. A love of 
good music seems to be implanted in the heart of every 
son of the great " Vaterland," be he prince or be he com- 
mon sailor. And the blue-jackets of Germany heave their 
anchors and haul their ropes to some Lied of Mendelssohn 
or chorus of Handel, as the British tar heaves and hauls to 
some quaint yo-ho-ing of his own composing. 

The following is a translation of another humorous song,

Music OF THE WATERS. 



well known to German seamen ; it has no title, but is sung 
to an exceedingly pretty air, which I have noted down as 
it was given me : 



GERMAN VERSION. 

Wenn das Atlantische Meer 
Lauter Champagner war ; 
Mocht ich ein Haifisch sein, 
Schliirfte nur Wellen ein. 

Wenn das Atlantische Meer 
Lauter Champagner war, 
War ich viel lieber doch 
Ein Schiff mit groszem Loch. 

Ging ich dann zu Grund ; 
Schliirft, in der letzten Stund, 
In deinen Schaum noch ein, 
Gluh'n der Champagner Wein. 



ENGLISH VERSION. 

If the Atlantic Sea 

Could only champagne be, 

I'd wish to be a shark, 

And swallow its waves for a lark. 

If the Atlantic Sea 
Could only champagne be, 
I'd wish with all my soul, 
To be a ship with a hole. 

When to the bottom I go, 
Then in that hour of woe, 
Still then thy foam I'd suck, 
O sparkling champagne cup ! 



Slightly suggestive of thirst, the idea of the Atlantic 
and its foam-crested breakers being turned into cham- 
pagne ! The tragic tone of the last verse is strangely 
mock-solemn.

The following song is, though nameless, a well-known 
one to the German seamen. The tune was just sung over 
to me, as it has never been in print

The song known as " Ankunft in Hamburg," or " Arrival

tars. It is sung to a melody known as " Roll dy jo nich 
op," which title gives the chorus to the song.

Always a jolly breeze, 
That is the way of the sailor. 
Damn you, boys ! haven't you seen 

Cuxhaven ? 
Don't look so silly. 
Stir the yellow peas ; 
Burnt they don't taste nice. 
Boy, reach me the bottle. 
Give each one a drink 
Every one in turn. 
Now then, don't you stop ! 
Now then, don't you stop !

There on the starboard side 

There's a little row. 

Yarn mop with a fall, Fred, 

For a little girl. 

It's not worth the while. 

What do I with such a daft joke ? 

Look ! we soon have land. 

Girls, reach us a hand. 

If they don't like us, then we'll shout 

at them, 

"Now then, don't you stop ! 
Now then, don't you stop ! 
Now then, don't you stop ! 
Now then, don't you stop ! " 

Now with jolly mind, 

We go with the tide 

Up the Elbe to Hamburg's Haven. 

Heave the anchor there : 

The Captain first goes to his wife : 

Open the big hatchway, 

The keel is alongside. 

" Now, boys, fast to the windlass. 

Now then, don't you stop ! now then, 

don't you stop ! 
Now then, don't you stop ! now then, 

don't you stop ! " 

When we have discharged, 
There's a lump of cash.

Now, boys, you must see that spree. 
Now, boys, you must see that spree.

Though, perhaps, not strictly admissible in a collection of 
sailors' songs, I cannot bring this short account of the 
German ones to a close without including that most beau- 
tiful of all beautiful water-legends, " The Lorelei :"

Of olden times a legend 
Haunts me for ever and aye.

Music OF THE WATERS. 



Die Luft ist kiihl und es dunkelt, ] 
Und ruhig flieszt der Rhein ; 
Der Gipfel des Berges funkelt 
Im Abend-Sonnenschein. 

Die schonste Jungfrau sitzet 
Dort oben wunderbar, 
Ihr goldnes Geschmeide blitzet, 
Sie kammt ihr goldnes Haar ; 

Sie kammt es mit goldenen Kamme 
Und singt ein Lied dabei ; 
Das hat eine wundersame 
Gewaltige Melodic. 

Den Schiffer im kleinen Schiffe, 
Ergreift es mit wildem Weh ; 
Er sieht nicht die Felsenriffe, 
Er schaut nur hinauf in die Hoh' ! 

Ich glaube, die Wellen verschlingen 
Am Ende Schiffer und Kahn ; 
Und das hat mit ihrem Singen 
Die Lorelei gethan. 



The air is cool, and it darkens, 
And calmly flows the Rhine ; 
The mountain summit glimmers 
In the evening sunshine. 

Above, in wondrous beauty, 
There sits a maiden fair; 
Her brilliant jewels glitter, 
She combs her golden hair. 

Combing her golden tresses, 
A song the while she sings, 
A song so weird, alluring, 
That through my heart it rings. 

Bewitched with woe and longing, 
The boatman is looking on high, 
Not heeding the threatening danger, 
That hovers round him so nigh. 

Methinks that the bark and boatman 
The treacherous waves have won ; 
And that, with her beautiful singing, 
The Lorelei has done. 



I have purposely given this translation of the beautiful 
poem, as so many English versions are published totally 
regardless of the music, and to my idea it seems scarcely 
worth while to translate any song-verses without having 
regard to the song itself. I have found many English ver- 
sions of this legend, all more or less inaccurate as a true 
description of the thrilling effect of the original words. 
Some of them even speak of the " fury of the sea, the rock- 
bound coast," &c., and surely if ever a legend were asso- 
ciated with a river, it is that of the Lorelei with the Rhine. 

The song " Freiheit, die Ich Meine," is often heard on 
board German vessels. The words are to be found in 
most books of German "Lieder," so I will content myself 
with giving a few bars of the melody.

" Goldne Abendsonne/' or " Golden Evening Sun," is 
too well-known a song for there to be any necessity to 
give the words or their English meaning ; it is often sung 
by the sailors in chorus at the end of their day's work. 



ALL CHORUS. 




" Auf Ihr Briider, laszt uns Wallen " is also a sailors' 
favourite, and when they meet on shore, and grow, as land- 
folk also do, convivial over their pipes and lager, then may 
be heard from some tavern or coffee-house the strains of 
the " Auf, Ihr Briider." I before remarked that German 
sailors, as well as the other sons of the old Vaterland, have 
a deeply-rooted love of good music, and looking through 
a very remarkably spelt note-book full of songs, strongly 
redolent of tobacco, which was written for me by a Ham- 
burg sailor during a period of convalescence in Newcastle 
Infirmary, I find the following gems mentioned as being 
favourites on board German vessels Mendelssohn's ex- 
quisite " Scheiden," " Parting," which they use as an out- 
ward-bound song, also his " Abschied vom Walde," or 
" Leaving the Forest ;" and Schubert's perfect " Wandrer's 
Nacht-Lied," with Gothe's words.

The effect of this beautiful song chanted for it is more

The following is the tune of the " Weinachts-Lied," or 
" Christmas Carol," that is sung by the German sailors for 
that festival. It is to be found, amongst many other well-

Lebewohl, adieu, adio, farewell all sad, all telling of separa-

never so real, as when the last glimpse of land fades from the 
eyes of those watching it from an "outward bound" vessel.

JUST across the North Sea, over the low sand-dykes of 
Holland, scarce higher than a ship's bulwarks, looked a 
race whom the spleeny wits of other nations declared to 

R 



242 Music OF THE WATERS. 

be born web-footed. Yet their sails were found in every 
sea, and, like resolute merchants as they were, they left 
to others the glory whilst they did the world's carrying. 
Their impress upon the sea-language was neither faint nor 
slight. They were true mariners, and from Manhattan 
Island to utmost Japan, the brown bright sides, full bows, 
and bulwarks of the Dutchman tumbling home were as 
familiar as the sea-gulls. Many words of daily use on 
shipboard are of Dutch origin ; for instance, " bowsprit " is 
a compound of English and Dutch. The word " boom " is 
also due to the low land of dykes, as is " camboose." For 
all their clumsy appearance, their vessels are laid on lines 
that are both true and sharp ; and the hardy Norsemen 
Vikings, and stately patrician Romans (who, by-the-bye, 
were at best but sea-soldiers and marines), learnt to their 
cost in the days when the rulers of the sea had yet to be 
proved, that in the squat, solid Dutchman they had a 
formidable rival. 

And the Dutch are still to the fore in all matters mari- 
time ; their thriving, busy ports are ample proof of that ; 
take, for instance, Amsterdam that most beautiful city on 
the Amstel : " The seamen seated on the quays, their legs 
hanging down, or leaning against the black balustrades, 
having a grave and solemn appearance. All are smoking, 
seemingly reflecting, but not thinking ; silent, but not 
dreaming. Fishermen from Marken returning to their 
island ; fishermen of Amsterdam who fish for the anchovy ; 
barrel-formed Tjalks loaded with merchandise ; the little 
steamboat which carries the passengers and letters for 
Harlengen ; all waiting at the sluices for the great gates 
which allow five ships to enter abreast, to open." 

I have quoted this passage from Henri Havard's delight- 
ful "Dead Cities of the Zuyder Zee." He says, "In the 
distance the ironclad frigates were seen, and we could hear 
the sailors singing their old sea-songs, nearly the same 
in all countries amongst mariners." Monsieur Havard's 
remark is peculiarly applicable to the Dutch. They have 



Music OF THE WATERS. 243 

for so long been a thorough-going sea people that many 
expressions and terms now used in sailors' parlance may 
be traced to them. It is not at all surprising to meet with 
a Dutch sailor who will tell you he knows the German, 
French, and English sea-songs thoroughly ; indeed, some 
of the Low German songs I give in the pages devoted to 
Germany are almost as much Dutch as German. The 
song, " The Jolly Cook," which is written in such a strange 
dialect, is well known to the sailors of Holland, and the 
same may be said of many of our chanties. Any day ir* 
Rotterdam, that most quaint old-world town, with its 
thronged busy quays, where are found a cosmopolitan lot 
of seamen, you may hear snatches of English song, as the 
men are busy with their work : 

" For there will come the sailors, 
Their voices I shall hear, 
And at the casting of the anchor, 
The yo-ho loud and clear ; 
And at hauling of the anchor, 
The yo-ho and the cheer." 

There is one phase of sea life, though, in which the Dutch 
are a people par excellence, namely, the fisheries ; it seems 
almost incredible to read of the amount of barrels of fish 
daily exported from Holland ; in fact, as some one wisely 
remarks, " The history of the country might be written in 
the fishing-nets," for there are dozens and dozens of little 
villages where the life of the inhabitants is simply herrings. 
Inside the dwellings, nets that are needing repair, tackle of 
all sorts, boat appliances, barrels for the salted fish, and 
women knitting their husbands', fathers', sons', or brothers' 
coarse warm jerseys : outside, signs of ships over the door- 
ways, lines of boats on the rugged and dangerous coast, 
herrings being salted and packed as fast as the busy hands 
of the brave daring fishermen can pack them, and over all 
a calm, satisfied cheerful contentment that is almost sad to 
witness when one thinks of the rude dispelling it must

often have, when the angry sea turns on the men who 
spend their lives in wresting their daily bread from the 
tempest These herring-fishers on the lonely Dutch coast 
live a strange life. A life of great hardship, earnest 
and unflagging industry, and small profit A life that is 
spent, like that of most of the people of Holland, in 
constant warfare with the sea, striving with works 
that have gone on for years, and that must go on as 
eternally as the tide, if the imperious monarch is to be 
kept back from the peaceful home-like land that his 
hungry billows would so fain ravage. There is something 
so noble in a people that are content to go on year after 
year combating so grand a foe, that one cannot wonder 
that the indomitable patience and perseverance displayed 
by the Dutch, in the very minutest details, has won them 
such rewards. 

Water plays such an important part in the life of the 
Dutch, and so much time has to be spent on it, that the 
people, who are characteristically chary of time, carry on 
all their usual occupations, and the women travelling in 
the tzekschuyten or gondolas reckon that from one town to 
another they can knit so much of a stocking. The Dutch 
boatmen who man these water omnibuses, and who by the 
way are among the most amiable watermen of the world, 
seem to find the water so evidently their sphere, that they 
never appear to be anxious to reach their journey's end. 
Water-boats, milk-boats, everything that is in daily use in 
Holland comes by canal, and it is a strange fact, that 
where there is so much water, there is yet a difficulty in 
finding any to drink, and it has often to be brought a great 
distance by boat to the towns ; it has been said " that in 
Holland wherever nature has failed to supply the sea or a 
river, the Dutch have made a canal." By this means 
most of their traffic is carried on all day with activity and 
some bustle, and in the evenings with a little relaxation 
and often to the strains of some popular song, sung in 
chorus, such as : 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



245 




In a book entitled " The Dutch at Home," by Monsieur 
Alphonse Esquiros, published by Chapman and Hall, 
Piccadilly, which describes most graphically the life and 
character of the fishermen and sea-people generally of 
Holland, there is an account of the fishermen of Vlaar- 
dingen. The author says that " up to recent years the 
departure of the boats for the great herring fishery was 
fixed for St. John's Day (June 24th). This departure was 
preceded by fetes, and a book of old Dutch songs still 
exists, sung by the fishermen as they put to sea. Toasts 
were proposed to the success of a fishery, and prayers 
offered up. At last sail was set, and the peaceful 
flotilla started for the herring conquest. At the present 
day the doggers start at the Beginning of June, and can 
open the fishery at once ; but faithful to tradition, or, if 
you will so, prejudice, the fishermen take advantage of 
this new liberty very reluctantly. The " herring," they say 
in their simple language, "does not like to be caught 
before St. John's Day." I have unsuccessfully attempted 
to find this old book of songs. Monsieur Esquiros has been 
dead some years, and his book (published in 1863) seems 



246 Music OF THE WATERS. 

but little known now. I have never read anything more 
generous than his opinion of the Dutch people, or an 
account so picturesque and interesting of their country. 

He also speaks of the lonely island of Marken. " The 
women/' he says, " hardly ever quit the island ; the men, 
on the contrary, inhale the breath and life of the sea. The 
flounder-catchers enter' their ^ boats at midnight each 
Sunday ; they pass the week in the Gulf, and only return 
home on Saturday night. The only day they spend ashore 
is employed in repairing nets, sacks, and tackle. Great 
dangers menace these indefatigable voyagers ; the wave of 
the Zuyder Zee is shorter and less tumultuous than that of 
the ocean, but it is perfidious. Their coolness amid dangers 
and storms equals their humanity ; ever ready to help im- 
perilled vessels, they have furnished proofs innumerable of 
their courage and presence of mind. The sea is the visible 
conscience of the fisherman of the Zuyder Zee, and he is 
ever anxious to prove himself honest and pure in its sight. 
They are, remarkably temperate men the cause, probably, 
of their longevity. You meet many old men on the island, 
and at the sight of their faces, calm as the sea on a fine 
summer night, you grow to love this humble mediocrity, 
.these poor people, rich in things they are ignorant of, and 
this family of fishermen who are so closely connected by 
a uniformity of labour, inclinations, and dangers." The 
house belongs to the wife ; but the fly-boat, the external 
house, to the husband. He displays the same coquetry 
and zeal in adorning this floating abode as his wife does in 
cleaning the cottage ; and on Sundays and holidays the 
fishing-boats 'collected in port seem rather a squadron 
of yachts arranged for the pleasure of the eye, than a fleet 
of toil and utility. But the wives of the fishermen of 
Marken have other duties besides that of cleaning the 
cottage to attend to. The first consists in the education of 
her children, which entirely devolves upon the mother 
sometimes the family numbers twelve children ; add to 
this the making of all their clothing, including the hus-

247 



band's : they also till the soil, make the hay, spin the hemp 
for the rigging, and bleach the linen. In these varied and 
complicated duties the housewife has no servant to assist 
her, all has to be done by one pair of hands. Truly the 
women of Marken must be deserving of that often mis- 
quoted title of "housewife;" the making and not the 
marring of a happy home surely lies in the sturdy, indus- 
trious helpmeets of the Marken fishermen. 

Mr. Robinson, the British Consul at Amsterdam, has very 
kindly interested himself in trying to obtain some of the 
Dutch sailors' songs for me, but, in a letter I have from him, 
he says that, " After having made many inquiries, he finds 
that there are no well-known sailors' songs now in exist- 
ence. The ditties in vogue among the sailors are those 
generally current amongst the lower classes, and are 
principally of a character which would unfit them for 
publication." 

I give one, however, of the herring fishery, with the 
translation of the words :

U, koningin van 't feest, u bien wij

Sprei, handel, Hollands gullen disch ! 
Nu zal de Vanderlandsche visch, 
We er d'eerste schotel zijn, weer 

d'eerste schotel zijn. 

Wie in dit kostlijk zeebanket 
Voor 't eerst de grage tanden zet, 
De voile flesch ontkurkt tot vreugd 

van zin en geest, 
Met fonkelende glazen klinkt, 
Ze op Neerlands welzijn ledig drinkt, 
Die houdt een heerlijk feest, die houdt 

een heerlijk feest. 



And let the joyful sound now re-echo 

along your strand, 

Here comes, laden with gold, the boat, 
Bringing us the first fresh herring ! 
It is a feast in Netherland, it is a feast 

in Netherland. 

Exalt ye ! cunning craft ! Pride of the 

Dutch fleet. 
To thee, queen of the feast, we offer 

the wine of honour : 
Let commerce spread Holland's liberal 

board ! 

Now shall the Fatherland's fish 
Again be the choicest dish, 
Again be the choicest dish. 

He who partakes of this precious sea- 
banquet for the first time, 

And uncorks the full bottle to the joy 
of sense and mind, 

Ringing the sparkling glass, and 
drinks it dry 

To " Netherland's Prosperity/' 

He keeps a glorious feast, he keeps a 
glorious feast.

Een Hollandsch kind, dat is bekend, 
Die vindt in Zee zijn element, 
Jo-ho, jo-ho, jo-ho, jo-ho ! 
Die vindt in Zee zijn element. 

En zijn wij zoo geen banjers meer 
Als in verleden dagen, 
Toen ieder voor Jan-Companie 
Een flikker had geslagen : 
Toch zeilen wij op iedre Zee 
Zoo goed nog als de beste mee, 
Jo-ho, jo-ho, jo-ho, jo-ho ! 
Zoo goed nog als de beste mee ! 

Hoezee dan jongens in het want ! 

De handen uit de mouwen, 

Laat Duitscher, Noor of Engelschman 

Neit klimmen in je touwen. 

Dan kan je varen zonder peil, 

Al blies de Nikker in het zeil, 

Jo-ho, jo-ho, jo-ho, jo-ho ! 

Al blies de Nikker in het zeil ! 



For a Hollander-born, you all must 

know, 

Finds in the sea his element, 
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho ! 
Finds in the sea his element. 

And if we cannot do the mighty deeds 
They did in the days gone by, 
When for the honour of the Dutch 

Company 

Every man in his heart did try. 
Yet still we sail in every sea 
As good as the best of them, 
Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho ! 
As good as the best of them ! 

Hurrah ! then, boys, up aloft, 

Up with your sleeves (look like work); 

Let neither German, Norwegian, nor 

Englishman 
Climb your rigging. 
Then you may sail without a care, 
Supposing the Devil should blow in 

your sail, 

Yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho, yo-ho ! 
Supposing the Devil should blow in 

your sail ! 

I cannot say much in favour of these words. Such a 
boasting spirit pervades them that it has been a most diffi- 
cult matter to obtain a translation, and to find adequate 
expression for some of the nautical phrases. The Dutch 
Company mentioned in the second verse evidently refers 
to the Dutch East India Company and its naval exploits. 
The last verse is perhaps the most difficult to render into 
English ; into English rhyme it neither can nor will go. 
The deficiencies of the words are, however, amply condoned 
by the extreme beauty of the music,

RUSSIAN SAILORS' SONGS. 

LIKE the army, the Russian Navy was the creation of 
Peter the Great. In coming to the throne he found his 
empire without any port save Archangel : at his death he 
left a fleet of the line in the Baltic, and his name feared as 
a naval hero in the Black Sea and the Caspian ; and that 
clause in his will in which he states, " that Russia, which I 
found a brook and left a river, must, under my successors, 
grow to a mighty sea, destined to fertilize worn-out Europe, 
and advance its waves over all obstacles, if my successors 
are only capable of guiding the stream," shows in what 
direction the great man's thoughts for the welfare of Russia 
ran, and how merely supplementary to it he regarded the 
army. 

From the earliest times there has been a slight halo of 
maritime glory around the Russian name. The half fabu- 
lous Varangians, Northmen, or Normans, who conquered 
Russia as they did France and England, and from whom the 
Russian nobility still boast their descent, were victorious 
by sea as well as by land, and the glories of Ruric and 
Vladimir belong to the Russian nation as much as the 
victories of Alfred and the Plantagenets belong to us. 

But after the fall of Novgorod, when the Baltic provinces 
fell into the power of the Swedes, the Poles, and the 
Germans, and Archangel was the only outlet left her, the 
maritime importance of Russia decreased, the Russians 
occupied themselves entirely with internal commerce, and 
the spirit of the Varangians disappeared, or only lingered 
among the Cossacks of the Dnieper and the Don. 



254 Music OF THE WATERS. 

In the beginning, the Russian Navy was formed entirely 
of foreigners, and principally of Englishmen, whilst the 
sailors and officers in the Black Sea were principally Greeks, 
and although the commerce of Russia is considerable, 
there is not, or at any rate up to the year 1844 there was 
not a single merchantman manned and sent out by 
Russians proper ; that is, by the Sclavonic population, 
which forms the real strength of the Russian Navy. 
Admirals Crown, Hamilton, Elphinstone, Dugdale, and 
Greig, and many of their own seamen who rose to posi- 
tions of importance, were brought up in the English Navy. 
The Greek influence until about 1840 was paramount 
in the Crimea, the languages most in vogue throughout 
the country were French and German. Small wonder, I 
think, that the Russian Navy should have so few charac- 
teristics, seeing of what cosmopolitan traits it is formed, 
and that its sailors should be of such little national in- 
dividuality, since so few real Russians are included 
amongst them. 

With regard to the small portion of maritime affairs in 
which I am at present interested, namely, " Sailors' Songs," 
I have not been able to make so varied or comprehensive 
a collection as I should have liked, seeing what a truly 
musical country Russia is, but several reasons have pre- 
vented my doing as much as I should have wished the 
chief being doubtless the cosmopolitanism that excludes 
anything partaking of a national character; another, I 
fancy, being that the Russian Navy is almost too young 
to have any history, and as I have before remarked, 
historical naval facts have invariably been the original 
theme of sailors' songs ; and a third is perhaps due to the 
fact that the " Russian sailors are all landsmen." The 
fleet is manned from the common conscription, with very 
little ethnologic distinction, excepting perhaps, that in the 
north preference is given to the Finns, and in the south to 
the Jew conscripts ; not on account of the aptitude dis- 
played by these latter for naval service, but because as

255 



soldiers they are considered worthless. In the case of the 
Finns it is different, seeing they are numbered amongst 
the best seamen in Russia. 

The crew, or " equipage," as the Russians call it, gene- 
rally includes twenty-five musicians, who supply the music 
that is necessary on some occasions, for there is, I am told, 
a good deal of ceremony observed in the Russian Navy. 
For instance, on setting out on a voyage, or on the return 
from a long one, the band will play the National Anthem, 
the sailors singing it bareheaded : 

" God protect the Czar, 
The right believing Czar ; 
His reign lead us to glory 

To glory, us ! 

Let him reign and confound his foes, 
The right believing Czar ; 
God, O God, protect the Czar ! " 

I have given the words quite literally, and without 
attempting to set them to the music, which, no doubt, 
adapts itself very suitably to the Russian syllables.

This is also performed at a launch, or indeed on any 
grand occasion. It is the great song of the Russian Navy, 
and its majestic chords and inspiriting martial style are 
very familiar on Russian shipboard. The effect of this 
song of praise on the water must be very grand ; for the 
Russian chanting is of great repute, and the sublimity of 
the sacred music of this country exceeds that of almost 
any other. 

The singular peculiarities of the double-bass voice which 
supports the chords of the chants of the national worship, 
together with the players of the horn-bands' automatons of

one note in Russia, are attributed by many to the state of 
serfdom, of no more real value in regard to art than so 
many organ pipes, since the singers or players can be little 
more than machines, comprising each a few select notes, 
whose owners are fit for small other service. However 
this may be, the Russian voice, be it free or slave, is 
universally allowed to be most melodious, and, like most 
northern countries, it would be impossible to overrate the 
freshness and vigour of its song melody. The sadness of 
it is seldom tinctured with languor ; the sweetness has 
something in it that braces as well as charms the sense. 
This may even be remarked when the minor key pre- 
dominates, as it does so largely in Russian music. 

I have dwelt somewhat at length on the national qualities 
of Russian music, since its music of the sea is largely 
composed of those popular " lieder" sung on shore. Thus 
the Russian sailor at his work will sing, not some quaint 
verses set to still quainter melody, as our blue-jackets do ; 
but the very songs that at that time are the most in vogue 
in his own country. These songs are used, as all sea-songs 
are, to give encouragement to the men, and to promote 
unity of labour. I asked a very intelligent Russian sailor 
if complaints of their food on ships or captain were not 
often sung in rhymed verse on board their ships, as is the 
case with our men, and he said, " No, they don't do it, but 
they might." They have rye, of black bread which, 
however, they prefer to wheaten bread. They drink 
" quass," a fermented drink made from the rye flour, and 
vodka, and they have meat twice a week. 

In fact, the chanty as we understand it is not known 
amongst Russian tars, they have their songs (Pesni, they 
call them) and their musicians on board, but of the im- 
promptu verses, a propos of so little, set to the original 
tunes, that so delight the hearts of most sailors, they know 
but little. The few that would come under the heading 
of "chanties," that I have heard, are so immeasurably 
superior to these as a rule, that they are worthy of a better

title and rank in musical parlance. The Baltic, with its 
many different divisions, has numbers of sea-songs, that is, 
songs of the sea, some being of the same type as Dibdin's. 
The Gulf of Finland is also rich in song-lore, the outcome, 
doubtless, of the famous Finnish mythology, and many of 
them probably will be legends of those pirates of old 
whose invasions were so dreaded. The Black Sea, chosen 
by all the ancient poets as the theatre of their hero's 
exploits, the scene of Ulysses' wanderings amongst the 
Laestrigons or Tauri, must also, one would think, have 
preserved many curiosities of rhyme. The fabled daughters 
of Achelous and Calliope had charmed all navigators until 
Ulysses approached the coast : 

" And lo ! the siren shores like mists arise ; 
Sunk were at once the winds ; the air above 
And waves below at once forgot to move ; 
Some demon calmed the air and smoothed the deep, 
Hush'd the loud winds and charmed the waves to sleep." 

POPE'S Odyssey, Book iv. 

" The oracle condemned them to die when a man should 
pass without stopping. Ulysses, warned of the danger, 
stopped his ears with wax, and safely passed them, bound 
to the mast. So they were changed into rocks, off 
Sorrento, where they still exist, a terror to manners. 
Another legend says they became rocks because Orpheus 
surpassed them in singing.'' l 

Lapland, it is said, has no sea-songs now, though I 
should fancy there must be at least a few handed down, 
from those old legends of the Laps driving a thriving trade 
by selling winds to the sailors, who, as Longfellow says, 
whistled for them : 

" Only a little hour ago 
I was whistling to St. Antonio, 
For a capful of wind to fill our sail, 
And instead of a breeze he has sent a gale." 
1 Cox's " Aryan Mythology." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



259 



Sir Walter Scott, in his " Rokeby," also alludes to this 
custom : 

" What gales are sold on Lapland's shore, 
How whistle rash bids tempests roar/' 

It has been said that " the genuine expression of popular 
feeling is always forcible, not seldom poetic ;" it certainly 
does seem that the truth of this is amply verified, as regards 
it being forcible, on board of a Russian man-o'-war, where 
a captain, if he be popular, will be tossed in the air, 
between a double line of sailors, in time with the following 
tune:

It seems a strange custom, and I should think the implied 
compliment would scarcely be one to cause unmitigated 
pleasure to the recipient. Those songs that are used on 
board are mostly sung in alternate soli and chorus, and at 
the same time and in the same place as our chanties are 
used. The same song seems to serve for holystoning the

of song ; I give the notes here :

CHORUS. 




One feature of Russian ship singing is certainly quite 
peculiar to itself, namely, that of the women singing in 
chorus while crushing the oats previous to their being 
shipped ; this they do -close to the vessel. The songs are 
usually of a sad nature, in slow measure, but they evi- 
dently help the work on, as regularity and unison are 
needed. I have given one of these songs, though really it 
can scarcely be quite in place in a collection of sailors' 
chanties ; but the extreme beauty of it, and the originality 
of its purpose, have tempted me to do so. There is some- 
thing very original, and one might almost add pathetic in 
the idea of this plaintive melody accompanying the words 
of these women on the wharf. The effect of it sung in 
chorus must be very pleasing. Another great favourite for 
this work is "The Nightingale," a very well-known Russian 
song, and one often used in seafaring life. I give it also.

For heaving the anchor I have found two songs, one ot 
which I give in the printed form as it was sent me from 
Odessa ; the other, of the genuine chanty style, as I took 
it down from a Russian sailor, of whom I feel a few words 
of praise are necessary. His knowledge of the national 
music of his country was extraordinary in a man of his 
position, and in literature he was not far behind. Mr. 
Ralston would, I am sure, have felt interested, if not 
flattered, by the encomiums passed on his book of Russian 
songs. 1 

In spite of his very evident taste for study and the 
amount of cultivation he possessed, my Russian tar was 
as quaint a specimen of that everywhere extraordinary 
species the genuine salt as I ever encountered, I had 
some opportunity for studying his character, for he was 
obliged while waiting for a certain ship to reside for some 
time near Newcastle-upon-Tyne. My father, in his capacity

264 Music OF THE WATERS. 

of Consul having been able to render him some assistance, 
he was very glad to be of use to the Consul's daughter ; 
and besides giving me the specimens of the Russian water- 
songs, he entertained me with many a comical story of 
sea-life, and some strangely cute remarks on the seamen 
of various nations. I happened to say how difficult I 
had often found it to induce the sailors to sing for me ; 
" I suppose it is because of their proverbial shyness," I 
added. " Your English sailors may be shy, miss, not that 
I have found them so," was the quick reply, " but I know 
the greatest amount of cheek that's how you call assurance, 
I believe in all Russia, is to be found in the navy." 

He had spent all his life at sea, that is, from a very 
tender age, and like many of my other sailor-guests, 
appeared to find great pleasure in examining the ordinary 
objects of an English drawing-room. "This is prettier 
than most cabins I have been in," he remarked, and then 
apparently thinking he had displeased me by such a 
candid opinion, he added, " In fact, it's about the best I've 
seen." 

Some one had evidently told him that it was the proper 
thing to shake hands with any one who entered a room 
while he was in it, for a lady coming in while he was 
singing one day, was evidently as much startled as I was, 
at having her hand most cordially gripped by a rough 
sailor. I ventured to point out to him, after she left, that 
this ceremony could be dispensed with, and indeed might 
not at all times be considered agreeable ; he took my hints 
in very good part, and the next time we were interrupted, 
contented himself with a profound bow. 

He told me that Russian sailors have a great love for 
birds, and that many of them, going on long voyages, ask 
permission to take some favourite caged songster with them. 
It was from this man I learnt of the popularity of the 
Russian National Anthem in the navy, and I have rarely 
heard more enthusiasm in any performance than he put 
into his Russian version of it when I played the anthem

for him to sing to. The following is a translation of the 
words of the chanty he sang for heaving the anchor : 

Solo. " As we lay on an afternoon, 
Chorus. On board of our jolly ship, 

Solo. In the shade made by our sails, 
Chorus. On board our jolly ship. 
And we sing jolly songs, 
And will sing them together, 
And go through the world as light as a feather, 
And go through the world as light as a feather."

The best-known, perhaps, of all the Russian sailors' songs 
is the one used for hauling. It is a national air, and a

Mr. Ralston, in his book, "Songs of the Russian 
People," says of the Cossack songs that " they are generally 
about the Don or the Volga ; along the banks of those 
rivers ride the Cossack horse, or on their waters float the 
Cossack boats/' He quotes one very well-known boat- 
man's favourite, " The Address to the River Don " : 

ADDRESS TO THE RIVER DON. 

" Father of ours ! famous, quiet Don, 
Don Ivanovich, our nourisher ! 
Great praise of thee is spoken, 
Great praise and words of honour : 
That thou didst swiftly run, 
Swiftly; but in olden days 
All clearly didst thou run, 
But now, our nourisher, all 
Troubled dost thou flow ; 
Troubled unto thy depths art thou, O Don ! 
Then glorious, quiet Don thus made reply, 
' How otherwise than troubled can I be ? 



268 Music OF THE WATERS. 

I have sent forth my falcons bright, 
My falcons bright, the Don Kazaks ; 
Deprived of them my steep banks crumble down. 
Deprived of them my shoals are thick with sand.' " 

"The traditions of the Russian peasants people the 
waters with spiritual inhabitants. Their songs and stories 
often speak of the Tsar Morskoi^ the marine or water- 
king, who dwells in the depths of the sea, or the lake, or 
the pool, and who rules over the subaqueous world. To 
this Slavonic Neptune a family of daughters is frequently 
attributed, maidens of exceeding beauty, who, when they 
don their feather dresses, become the swan maidens who 
figure in the popular literature of so many nations. The 
graceful creatures, however, as well as their royal parent, 
belong to the realm of the peasant's imagination rather 
than to that of his belief." (Ralston.) 

The Vodyany, or water-sprite of Russia, inhabits the 
depths of rivers, lakes, or pools, but sometimes he dwells 
in swamps (not necessarily dismal), and he is especially 
fond of taking up his quarters in a mill-stream, close to the 
wheel. Every mill is supposed to have a Vodyany attached 
to it, or several Vodyani I believe this to be the correct 
way of speaking of these gentlemen in the plural if it 
have more than one wheel. Consequently, millers are 
generally obliged to be well-versed in the black art, for if 
they do not understand how to treat the water-spirits all 
will go ill with them. The Vodyany is also a patron of 
bee-keeping, and it is customary to enclose the first swarm 
of the year in a bag, and to throw it, weighted with a 
stone, into the nearest river, as an offering to his august 
subaqueous Majesty. He who does this will assuredly 
flourish as a bee-master, especially if he takes a honeycomb 
from a hive on St. Zosima's Day, and flings it at midnight 
into a mill-stream. The Vodyany is not prepossessingly 
represented by the people, and is supposed to be much 
given to drinking and card-playing and other vices, which 



Music OF THE WATERS. 269 

one would not expect to find in a monarch of the 
waters. 

The water-sprite's wives are popularly supposed to be 
women who have been drowned, or whom a parent's curse 
has placed within the power of the evil one. They have 
great influence over the weal or woe of fishermen and 
sailors, ofttimes luring them to death and destruction. 

The Russian peasants sign a cross on the water with a 
knife or scythe before bathing, and they never go into 
the water without a cross round their neck, or after sunset. 
It is considered especially dangerous to bathe during the 
week in which falls the feast of the prophet Ilya (Elijah, 
formerly Perun, the Thunderer), for then the Vodyany is 
on the look-out for victims. The bodies of his victims he 
allows to float ashore, but their souls he keeps in his watery 
kingdom, making them his servants. Bohemian fishermen 
are afraid of assisting a drowning man, as they think the 
Vodyany will drive away the fish from their nets. In the 
Ukraine they have a tradition that, when the sea is rough, 
such half-fishy " marine people " appear on the surface of 
the water and sing songs. The Chumaki (local carriers) 
go down at such times to the sea-side, and there hear those 
wonderful songs, which they afterwards sing in the towns 
and villages. In other places these " sea-people" are called 
" Pharaohs," being supposed, like the seals of Iceland, to 
be the remains of that host of Pharaoh which perished in 
the Red Sea. The water-nymphs of Russia are known as 
Rusalkas.

GREEK WATER-SONGS. 

I HAD hoped to have had at least a small collection of 
Greek songs to add to the others, but I have been disap- 
pointed. The modern Greek evidently heaves and hauls 
and rows almost in silence, at least so far as vocal music 
is concerned. I applied to Sir George Macfarren on the 
subject of ancient Greek water-songs, and his answer was 
as follows 

" DEAR MADAM, But three vestiges of ancient Greek 
music are known to exist. These are a hymn to Apollo, 
one to Nemesis, and to Calliope ; and even they date from 
within the Christian era. The music originally sung in the 
plays of Sophocles or any other of the dramatic poets is 
lost, and its reproduction in any form totally impossible.

I have not been able either to learn anything through 
the Consuls or any other authorities on the Greek language, 
literature, and music of the day. Miss Lucy M. J. Garnett 
has made a collection of folk-songs in Greece, but there 
is little mention of anything like water-songs ; the one 
there is, however, I quote by the kind permission of the 
authoress. I have also found one Greek sailors' song and 
a boat-song which follow, but there were no words given 
to either of them.

Isaac D'Israeli, in his " Curiosities of Literature," men- 
tions the numerous labour-songs used by the ancient 
Greeks, threshing-songs, those for encouraging the fine arts, 
builders' songs, weavers', dairy songs, and amongst others 
the sailors' singing is alluded to, so that we may suppose 
they had some tunes equivalent to the modern chanty ; but 
these have not been preserved, so I am, however, unwillingly 
obliged to content myself with these short remarks on the 
water-songs of this most classic land.

Music OF THE WATERS. 




A GULF not to be spanned divides the harmonies of the 
east from those of the west. The Japanese seem to dislike 
our music, and to find it as wanting (according to their 
ideas) in harmony, as we find theirs mysterious and dis- 
cordant. 

The music of the " Empire of the Rising Sun," like most 
of its arts and sciences, is mainly Chinese and Corean, and 
its theory has, therefore, the usual spirit of mystical Chinese 
speculation, which, basing the forces and phenomena of 
nature upon the number 5, declares that, as sounds belong 



Music OF THE WATERS. 281 

to such phenomena, there must be five tones ; but in stringed 
instruments, which are all they have in Japan, they make 
use of chromatic divisions, although the five tones alone 
are recognized officially. 

Seeing what an important place Japan now takes amongst 
the maritime countries of the world, it may not be unin- 
teresting to attempt some study of the songs used by its 
sailors. From the little I have been able to gather, I should 
conclude that they very much resemble those used by our 
own blue-jackets, or rather the occasions on which they 
are used are similar, their object namely, unity and regu- 
larity in work is the same, and the variety of subject ; but 
there the likeness ceases, for, as I have said, the gulf is 
not to be spanned that divides our and Eastern music. 

It is only on board of their merchant-vessels that 
singing is allowed, the Japanese Navy not permitting 
the practice on the men-of-war, a band taking the place of 
the chanty. This probably consists of the " sho," which 
seems to correspond to our organ, but only in so far as it 
has pipes. A " koto " also will be found, an instrument 
not unlike the violin, and probably a "fuye," which is a 
Japanese flute. Of course there are many varieties of 
these three, but I believe they will always be found in a 
Japanese orchestra. The "sho" and the "fuye"" have 
tremendous power, and if it be true that silence is a 
characteristic of nature in Japan (singing-birds being very 
rare, and only the deep, troubled tones of the crows being 
heard), what an extraordinary effect this most penetrating 
orchestra must produce in the stillness that reigns in the 
waters round the empire. Like most sailors, the Japanese 
seem to take great pride in handing down to posterity the 
noble deeds of their countrymen, and the bravery of the 
chieftains who held sway in feudal times forms the theme 
of many of their sea-songs. 

Almost all these songs are in very slow time, and nearly 
all are set in a minor key. I think I am not far wrong in 
stating that this is the case in every kind of Japanese 



282 Music OF THE WATERS. 

music (at least, in all that I have heard). The sailors' songs 
are mostly chromatic passages with but little variation. 
An occasional lowering or raising of a tone is sometimes 
unexpectedly introduced, in some a continued series of 
shakes produces an extraordinarily weird effect, especially 
as the minor key is here, as elsewhere, adopted. 

To my idea their rowing-songs are decidedly the most 
pleasing of all ; they have really a very charming effect. 
Musically speaking, they may not be very pretentious, but 
they may be taken as an indication of the style and cha- 
racter of the nation they belong to. They are sung on the 
" sampans," partially triangular-shaped boats, something 
like the salmon -fisher's punt used on certain British rivers. 
They are sculled, not what we should call rowed, by two 
or four men with very heavy oars, and they stand up, 
using their thighs to rest the oars upon. I give the notes 
of one of these as accurately as I can, the words I am 
unable to translate. A very distinguished member of the 
Japanese naval college, perfectly acquainted with our 
language, assures me they have no meaning, that is, none 
that can be translated :

The chorus is to give emphasis to certain strokes, and is 
repeated alternately with the solo without any change of 
either words or tune. 

Dice seem to play a very important part on board 
Japanese vessels. The dice-box is regarded as an essential. 
Perhaps I am wrong in giving the word as dice ; it may 
be rather the game of " go," which Miss Bird, in her book, 
"Unbeaten Tracks in Japan," refers to as being such a 
great resource in the country. It is played with 1 80 white 
discs cut from a species of cockle-shell, and 181 black ones 



Music OF THE WATERS. 283 

made from a black pebble ; the board is divided into 361 
squares, and the game consists in trying to enclose a 
certain space and preventing the opponent from doing the 
same. In days gone by, some horrible legend about instant 
death to the vanquished in this game was current. To 
think of this fatal gambling at sea, brings to one's mind 
that horrible phantom ship in Coleridge's "Ancient 
Mariner " : 

" The naked hulk alongside came, 
And the twain were casting dice ; 
The game is done : ' Fve won ! I've won ! ' 
Quoth she, and whistles thrice." 

Many harbours, as in our country, claim for their own 
certain chanties. Some of these become popular, and are 
soon heard all over Japan or wherever the Japanese flag is 
hoisted, but in some harbours the prerogative of singing 
them is retained. There is one sung when lifting heavy 
cargo, peculiar to the harbour of Matsumai, although its 
popularity amongst the sailors of other ports has led to its 
becoming an established Japanese sea-song. Matsumai is 
also the name of a great chieftain who lived in feudal 
times, and was a man of such renowned bravery that no 
one could beat him. He seems to have had no rival in 
strength, and has been handed down to posterity as a naval 
Samson. It is also sung when pulling the ropes, though 
more generally when lifting any heavy weight. While the 
solo is being sung, the rest hold themselves in readiness 
either to pull or to heave, as the case may be.

The same notes serve throughout the song, which is a

Then there is a short song for when they are scrubbing 
or, as we say, holystoning the decks. It is sung in chorus, 
and has, at least to us, no meaning. It seems to help 
them, however, in their work, and, as far as I have been 
able to learn, is the only one they use for this purpose.

Another song that Japanese sailors sing, and one that I 
believe is quite peculiar to themselves, is the song sung 
during a calm at sea, when work is for the time being sus- 
pended. A favourite one is about Nagareyama, a place 
celebrated, in Japan, for its wine, and the song is descrip- 
tive of the sailors taking this wine away to distant countries 
and exchanging it for the gold and treasures thereof. It 
appears that they have a curious custom of placing near 
the masts, when a ship is launched, some maidenhair-fern 
and rice. The maidenhair is looked upon as something 
almost sacred in Japan ; and rice, as is well known, is to the 
Japanese what fish is to the Esquimaux, or oatmeal to the 
Scotchman therefore, I suppose, they are chosen as 
omens of good luck, to be, as they call them, " the gods 
of the ship." This custom is also alluded to in the song 



MUSIC OF THE WATERS. 



285 



Nagareyama ; it is sung throughout in chorus, only the 
songs that accompany heavy work being in the form of 
alternate soli and chorus. 

I give a few of the notes which will show the style of 
the music ; it is to our ideas monotonous, as there are 
many verses and only these few tones to set them to : 

NAGAREYMNA. (SONG SUNG DURING A CALM AT 

SEA.) 

*

tr 




The first and third lines and second and fourth of this 
song are sung by the same men, not as soli but in 
chorus : 

" Nagareyma, naggarete ritaka, 
Nagareyma nagaretewo ronai, 
Murano nadesoya 
Medetaimonowa ofunadama 
Asa, oroshi banniwa, koganeo 
Isumifuruiso." 

In the Gulf of Yedo, the populous coast is very impres- 
sive thousands of fishing-boats skimming here and there, 
sampans being sculled in all directions the general appear- 
ance is colourless, the sea is pale, the coast grey, the 
boats are pale (their hulls being unpainted wood, and their 
sails pure white duck), whilst overhead, 13,080 feet above 
the sea, gleams in its dazzling pallor the wondrous truncated 
cone of snow, the sacred mountain of " Fujisan," so dear 
to the Japanese. The air and water seem motionless, the 
mist hangs still and ghost-like, grey clouds rest on a bluish 
sky, the .reflections of the white sails of the fishing-boats 
scarcely seem to quiver ; it is all (says Miss Bird, in her 



286 Music OF THE WATERS. 

poetical description) 1 " so pale and wan and peaceful, that 
the very turbulence of crumpled foam which we leave 
behind us, and our noisy throbbing progress, seem a boister- 
ous intrusion upon sleeping Asia." It is with a scene like 
this before one on the silence of nature reigning around, 
that one can imagine the song " Nagareyama " rising from 
some of the idle becalmed vessels around ; if anything had 
been wanting to complete the weird effect, it would be 
found in this mournful, monotonous dirge-like tune, so 
suggestive of the calm that gave birth to it. A Japanese 
vessel at a time like this resembles Shelley's exquisite 
description of the " Boat on the Serchio " : 

" Our boat is asleep in Serchio's stream, 
Its sails are folded like thoughts in a dream, 
The helm sways idly, hither and thither/' 

Japanese sailors and fishermen, like those of every other 
nation, are great believers in the supernatural, and many 
strange customs, curious legends, and beliefs of sailor- 
lore are rife amongst them. Miss Bird says a fisherman 
never considers it lucky to meet a priest (bonze) on his 
way to his boat ; it is considered lucky to dream of sailing 
in a ship. The Japanese have a tradition that their 
ancestors came from the skies in a boat, and another to 
the effect that fish are the embodiment of the souls of 
naval officers. Both Japanese and Chinese sailors consider 
it a good omen to cross the bows of a foreign vessel, and 
frequently give great trouble in crowded channels, and 
incur considerable danger from this cause. 

Speaking of mermaids, Mr. Bassett, in his recently 
published book of " Legends and Superstitions of the Sea 
and of Sailors," says : " Japan is, however, the headquarters 
of these coy maidens." Here an old Dutch navigator 
obtained the first " veritable " mermaid, and they may still 
be procured of ingenious natives ; numbers have been 

1 " Unbeaten Tracks in Japan." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 287 

shown in museums, &c., deftly made by uniting a child's 
head to a fish's body. 

At Bartholomew fair, in 1825, there was exhibited a mer- 
maid obtained by a Dutch ship from Japan, and the 
Ottoman minister to Paris, in 1840, related that he had 
seen a veritable sea-woman brought from Eastern seas. 
They have a legend relating that a mermaid prophesied 
an epidemic. 

I must not close these few remarks on Japanese seamen 
without some mention of the Ainos, that tribe of simple, 
indolent savages, whose life is so made up of the sea that 
one can handly disassociate them in one's mind. The 
Ainos are the aborigines of the Yezo ; the race is gradually 
becoming extinct, scarcely to the sorrow of the Japanese, 
who regard them with feelings of great contempt. They 
live only on the coasts, and subsist solely on what they reap 
from the harvest of the sea. As they are without written 
characters, minus any literature, and apparently most un- 
willing to give any information concerning themselves 
even to those who can understand them it is almost 
impossible to learn anything of their music, or even if they 
have any ; but from an account given, in a description of 
them, of a musical instrument they use, something like 
a guitar, made of three or six strings formed of whales' 
sinews cast upon the shore, we may infer that they do 
sing and probably use this most original instrument to 
accompany their crooning ditties. That these will be wild, 
unintelligible performances to us I doubt not, but that 
they can offer more extraordinary phases of musical 
history than the general music of Japan I can scarcely 
believe. It may be that the lonely Aino's song, with only 
nature for audience, may partake more of the true sweet- 
ness which marks all her melodies, for the very boom of 
the surf, the strange cries of the sea-birds, the hoarse notes 
of the audacious crows, are all in themselves complete and 
perfect studies of harmony, for nature when left to herself 
never produces discords, either in sound or colour. 



288 Music OF THE WATERS. 

And now I must close my remarks on the blue-jackets 
of the " Empire of the Rising Sun." Incomplete and 
it may be inaccurate they are, but the distance that 
separates our world from theirs, the scanty communication 
that up till a few years ago existed between us, and the 
general ignorance shown in their country, government, and 
social life, may suffice to explain the difficulty of obtaining 
facts concerning so small a portion of the history of a 
people as their sailors' songs. With the impetus given to 
matters maritime at home and abroad, the undoubted zeal 
and ability displayed by its enterprising engineers, the 
magnitude and importance of its naval college, we may 
expect ere long to see Japan in the front rank, if not fore- 
most, of the maritime nations of the world. 



NILE BOATMEN'S CHANTS. 



THE BOATMEN'S SONGS ON THE NILE. 

"THE main streets crossed each other at right angles, 
from wall to wall with beautiful breadth, and to the length, 
if it may be credited, of nearly nine miles. At their ex- 
tremities the gates looked out on the gilded barges of the 
hill of fleets at sea, under full sail, on a harbour that 
sheltered navies, and a lighthouse that was the mariner's 
star, and the wonder of the world." Such is Campbell's 
description of Alexandria in Mehemet Ali's time. A long 
line of windmills on a sandy ridge, the new lighthouse and 
palace built by the present pasha, and the tall column of 
Diocletian, the only visible wreck of the ancient city, are 
the few prominent objects which rise above the dead level 
of the sea. 

" The entrance to the harbour is difficult, but its spacious 
area is thronged with ships of war, steamers, merchantmen, 
and all the smaller craft incident to extended traffic. Yet 
the first view of Alexandria, full as it is of historical remi- 
niscences, is, in all other respects, more unimposing than 
that of any other city on the Mediterranean." This is the 
description given of it by Mr. Bartlett, in 1845, m his "Nile 
Boat." 

The boatmen of the Nile are not less pious in their way 
than the rest of the Egyptian Arabs, or less accustomed to 
the use of those religious forms so characteristic of Mahome- 
dan intercourse. Their mutual salutations are all prayers, 
like those of Boaz and his reapers : " Peace be upon you ' r 

U 2 



292 Music OF THE WATERS. 

" God be with you " " May God receive you into 
Paradise," are common expressions interchanged between 
passing crews, and they never pass, even at a distance, 
without saluting one another. The songs with which they 
encourage one another at the labour of the oar are in a 
similar strain of invocation, and often have a very beautiful 
effect. The Rets leads the air, and the boatmen sing in 
chorus, increasing the fervour of their chant and the vigour 
of their labours almost to frenzy, with the difficulty to be 
surmounted. Nothing can be done with them without fre- 
quent presents of meat or money. Dr. Olin says that " Gra- 
tuities of all sorts, in money, food, or any other form, are 
denominated ' bucksheesh.' This is the first word in the 
language which a traveller is likely to learn, and the least 
tenacious memory is in no danger of forgetting it. If you 
speak kindly to the Reis or sailors, or even look upon them 
with an unclouded brow, they demand this species of tribute. 
If the wind proves favourable or we succeed in driving them 
to their work a little earlier than usual, or in keeping under 
sail till the sun is fairly out of sight, it is sure to be hailed 
as an auspicious occasion when we may testify our appro- 
bation by a gratuity. In all their narratives they have no 
other standard of excellence than the amount of bucksheesh 
bestowed upon them. The man who has given them 
liberal bucksheesh, no matter if he has flogged them every 
day, is always excellent. All others are evil in their 
sight." 

The singing of the sailors on the Nile has frequently 
been noticed and described. This usually consists of alter- 
nate solo and chorus in short phrases, and varies with the 
nature of the occupation in which the men happen to be 
engaged. Thus one particular air is sung when they 
shift the sails ; another when the boat strikes on a sandy 
bank, and they are working to set it afloat again ; a 
third when the wind is favourable and they give themselves 
up to singing con amore, a fourth when approaching a 
village, and so on. Several efforts have been made to pro-

cure more specimens of these Nile choruses, but unsuccess- 
fully ; I have met with one or two, however, which I give. 
The following is a sample of the songs used when approach- 
ing a village :

At the head of the pleasure-boats of the Nile a man 
usually stood, with a long pole in his hand, to sound every 
now and then, and to prevent the boat running upon any 
of the numerous sand-banks in the river (which, from their 
often changing at the time of the inundation, are not always 
known to the most skilful pilot) ; a precaution adopted 
sometimes too late by the modern boatmen of the Nile. 
The same weird sort of chant or plumbing song is used for 
this as by the Lascars on the Brahmaputra. 

The papyrus boats, mentioned by Pliny, must have been 
the same as the " Vessels of bulrushes," spoken of in Isaiah ; 
indeed they are frequently alluded to by ancient writers. 
Plutarch describes Isis as going in search of the body of 
Osiris " through the fenny country, in a bark made of the 
papyrus, whence it is supposed that persons using boats of 
this description are never attacked by crocodiles, out of 
fear and respect for the goddess." There is a song men- 
tioned in connection with the building of these same boats, 
but it does not appear to have been put on record, as far as 
I have been able to ascertain. 



INDIAN WATER-SONGS. 



INDIAN WATER-SONGS. 

IN the Rig- Veda, or the sacred books of the Brahmans, 
several hymns are addressed to the waters (Ap), some to 
Nadi (the rivers), and some to Maruts (the storms) ; so 
the connection between Indian music and the world of 
waters is one of great antiquity and classical association. 

In Mr. W. D. Whitney's article on the Veda? he gives 
amongst other portions of the work a few of the hymns 
to the great rivers : one, an account of the propitiation 
of the two branches of the Indus the modern Beas and 
Sutlej by songs and praises from the Saint Viqvdmitra> 
chief priest of the Bharatas.

INDIAN ROWING AND BOAT-SONGS. 

The sailors of the province of Sinde, in Hindustan, have 
their peculiar songs, as seafaring men generally have. 
They are Mohammedans, and the songs used by them 
when they are pulling their ropes and sails often contain 
expressions of reverence to their saints. The translator of 
the following specimen of these songs praises its simplicity 
and beauty of expression in its original language : 

Pull, oh ! pull ! 
Raise your shoulders, 
Press your feet. 
The boat will sail, 
The steersman's a warrior. 
The mast is tall : 
Beat the drum ; 
The port is attained. 
Use your strength ; 
By the favour of God, 
By the saints' assistance, 
She is a pretty boat : 
The water is deep, 
She will harbour in safety. 
Of King Acbar, 
By the favour of God." > 

Sirens existed in Indian waters and lulled mariners to 
sleep by their songs. In speaking of them, in his "Legends 
and Superstitions of the Sea and of Sailors," Mr. Bassett 

1 From Engel's " Music of the Most Ancient Nations." 



Music OF THE WATEBS. 



301 



says, " They represent the white and shining surf, whose 
harmonious murmurs and seductive brightness allures, but 
destroys the mariner who attempts to land." 

" Sometimes upon the diamond rocks they leant, 

Sometimes they sat upon the flowery lea 
That sloped toward the wave, and ever sent 
Shrill music o'er the sea. 

" One piped, one sang, one swept the golden lyre, 

And thus to forge and ring a threefold chain 
Of linked harmony, the three conspire, 
O'er land and hoary main/' 

The following is a specimen of the Indian rowing-songs 
used on the " Rio Negro " in South America :

The following song is a sort of labour-song or chant of 
the Madras boatmen. The grain-ships are unloaded at 
Madras, and the cargo taken by Musulah boats ; these are 
pushed through the surf, and it is then that this song or 
chant may be heard ; when they near the ship again, the 
surf being deeper and more force being required, they break 
into the Ya-Allah, Ya-Allah, Ya-Allah, in sharp, almost 
spasmodic tones, and continue till they are through it.

CHINESE BOATMAN'S SONG. 
THE CAPTAIN.- 





U A LARGE portion of that which has passed, and is 
still passing with the Chinese for music to be enjoyed, 
distances barbarian sympathies and defies barbarian 
analysis. Their ideas of music are so at variance with 
every one of our feelings, fancies, practices in art, or ideas 
of beauty, that one can only wonder at them while listen- 
ing to them ; for wonderful it is, that a people so rich and 
ancient as the Chinese, one so advanced in the knowledge 
of secrets of colour, refinement of texture, peculiarity of 
form ; so skilled in exquisite caligraphy a people to boot 
who possess a philosophy, a fiction, and a drama of their 
own, all indicating a separate civilization, should be so 
utterly savage and repulsive in their musical tendencies. 
What we know of Chinese melody is in every respect 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



313 



more rude and shapeless than that of far more savage 
peoples." 1 

Mr. Chorley's remark is scarcely encouraging as to the 
amount of pleasure we may expect to derive from a perusal 
of some of the musical efforts of the Chinese ; however, 
such specimens of their water melody as are to be had I 
must include in a collection that has for object, not so 
much beauty of style, as peculiarity of conception. 

In all Asiatic nations, the songs are generally of a nature 
which renders it almost impossible to write them down 
divided into bars of equal duration. 

Whatever our opinion of Chinese music may be, it can- 
not be less flattering than theirs of ours. A very intelli- 
gent Chinese on hearing some music of Rameau's and 
other French composers, hinted politely that it was sadly 
devoid of meaning and expression, while the music of his 
own country penetrated to the innermost soul. 

The common scale of the Chinese consists of only five 
different intervals, though I should add this is also the case 
with the music of many other Asiatic countries, and even 
in other parts of the globe. The number five appears to 
be an especially mysterious one with the Chinese. I give 
this almost national tune a place amongst the water 
melodies, as it is a great favourite on sea as well as on land, 
and it is a fair specimen of Chinese song. 

CHINESE AIR. (" MOO-LEE-WHA.") 




m 






1 Chorley's "National Music." 



314 Music OF THE WATERS. 

Sir John Barrow gives an English translation of the 
words of the song " Moo-lee-wha ;" it is in praise of the 
flower Moo-lee : 

" How delightful this branch of fresh flowers ! 
One morning, one day, it was dropped in my house. 
I, the owner, will wear it not out of doors, 
But I will hold the fresh flower and be happy. 
How delightful this branch of the Moo-lee flower ! 
In the full plot of flowers blooming none excels it ; 
I, the owner, will wear this gathered branch, 
Wear it, yet fear, the flower seen, men will envy." 

As the gondoliers of Venice while away their long 
midnight hours on the waters with strophes of Tasso, the 
Greek sailors of the Archipelago with fragments of Homer, 
so the trackers in China accompany their severe labour 
with a song. Mr. Ellis, in his book of travels in that 
country, mentions that the sight of the lofty pagoda of 
Tong-chow, served as a great topic of incitement in the 
trackers' song. 

A traveller in China has remarked that " A Chinaman 
rehearsing a song looks and gives utterance to such goat- 
like bleats, that it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that 
he is labouring under a violent attack of chronic whooping- 
cough, combined with intermittent seizures of hiccough 
the dying falls of the inhuman falsetto at the end of 
each verse finishing in the most confounding hysterical 
perturbations of the vocal chords." 

The Chinese are excellent sailors, and in many points 
not at all unworthy of comparison with our own. A great 
number of them were for some time on the Tyne, 
awaiting the completion of one of their vessels at 
Elswick. They seemed to be very general favourites, 
and usually walked about with an attendant crowd of 
admirers. They were very polite ; indeed, one of the 
officers was so gallant on one occasion, when he was out 
spending the evening with some friends, that he cut all 



MUSIC OF THE WATEES. 315 

the buttons off his uniform and presented them to the 
ladies present, because one of them had admired the work- 
manship of them. 

A party of six of the sailors rinding themselves one day 
at some little distance from the town, hailed a four-wheeled 
cab and, in spite of the remonstrances of the driver, insisted 
upon all getting in ; when they reached their destination 
the man demanded his fare six shillings. " No, no," 
said one of the Chinamen, "big car, two pennies, little 
car, one penny ;" and to the extreme disgust of the cab- 
driver and the keen delight of some passers-by, he pro- 
ceeded to dole out six coppers. It took some persuasion 
on the part of some Englishmen, who interested themselves 
in the proceedings, and a great many remarks not compli- 
mentary to the sons of the Celestial Empire from the 
driver, to induce the sailors to give the proper amount. 
They had been accustomed to daily rides in the tram- 
cars, for which they paid twopence, and appeared to 
resent as an injustice the additional fare for "the small 
car." 

I was walking one day in the old part of Newcastle, when 
I was accosted by one of them with, " Please, will you 
tell me where is the boot hill ? " For a minute or two I was 
puzzled ; then it dawned upon me he meant the shoe stairs, 
a quaint flight of steps bordered with antique-looking 
boot and shoe shops that is one of the curiosities of old 
Newcastle. I directed him we were only about two 
minutes' walk from the place and after he had gone I 
followed him to see what he was doing ; and on my 
arrival I beheld him seated outside one of the shops, the 
centre of an admiring crowd of men, women, and children, 
the latter amusing themselves with his pigtail, whilst the 
proud owner of the shop knelt in front of him making 
strenuous efforts to fit the Chinese Jack with a pair of 
his best hob-nailed boots. Remembering the story of the 
cab, I wondered whether, when it came to paying, there 
would be any difficulty. Presently the fit of a pair seemed 



316 Music OF THE WATEES. 

to be agreed upon, they were wrapped up in a piece of 
newspaper, and the price evidently named ; Jack appeared 
quite willing to pay it. After some little further talk, he 
resumed his seat and took off his own boots ; he must be 
going to leave them for repairs, I thought, and the shop- 
keeper must have thought the same, for he received them 
smilingly, and was just beginning to examine them and 
see what they required, when Jack, who had meanwhile 
been lacing on his new purchases, suddenly sprang on to 
his feet and bounded down the long flight of irregular steps 
with the agility of a cat. As soon as he recovered his 
surprise the boot-maker went after him, and likewise all 
the denizens of the stairs. I have no doubt a regular 
fight would have ensued at the bottom, if the wily customer 
had not out-distanced him. 

The following description of the singing of Chinese 
river boatmen is given by a well-known English traveller 
in China : " On board the yachts constant mirth and 
good humour prevailed among the seamen. When the 
weather was calm the vessels were generally pushed on by 
means of two large sculls or oars turning upon pivots 
placed in projecting pieces of wood near the bow of the 
vessel, and not the stern, as is 1 the practice of most other 
nations. From six to ten men are required to work one of 
these oars, which, instead of being taken out of the water, 
as in the act of rowing, are moved backwards and forwards 
under the surface in a manner similar to what in England 
is understood by sculling. To lighten their labours and 
assist in keeping time with the strokes, the following rude 
air was generally sung by the master, the whole crew 
joining in chorus :

" On many a still evening, when a dead silence reigned 
upon the water, we have listened with pleasure to the 
artless and unpolished air, which was sung with little 
alteration through the whole fleet. Extraordinary exer- 
tions of bodily strength, depending in a certain degree on 
the willingness of the mind, are frequently accompanied 
with exhilarating exclamations among the most savage 
peoples ; but the Chinese song could not be considered in 
this point of view. Like the exclamations of our seamen 
in hauling the ropes, or the oar-song of the Hebridians, 
which, as Dr. Johnson has observed, resembles the pro- 
celeusmatic verse by which the rowers of Grecian galleys 
were animated, the chief object of the Chinese chorus 
seemed to be that of combining cheerfulness with regu- 
larity." 



NEW ZEALAND. THE MAORIES. 

It is said of the Maories, in New Zealand, that they are 
so much attached to singing as often to spend the entire 
night in its gratification, and all work is prosecuted with 
the aid of song. 

Mr. Shortland has collected the words of several of the 
songs or, more properly speaking, chants which are 
used by the Maories when they are hauling heavy logs of 
wood or canoes overland, in order to ensure a simultaneous 



318 Music OF THE WATERS. 

effort of the men engaged in the work. The five lines at 
the commencement, called Puwha or Hari, are sung by a 
single voice, to prepare the labourers for pulling, and the 
lines which follow the Puwha are sung alternately, solo and 
tutti, the labourers always responding in chorus to the 
singing of the leader, and hauling the boat at the same 
instant all together : 

Solo. " Pull, Tainui, pull the Arawa, 
To launch them on the ocean. 
Surely glanced the bolt 
Of thunder, falling hitherward, 
On my sacred day. 
The Kiwi cries 
Chorus. Kiwi. 

Solo. The Moho cries 
Chorus. Moho. 

Solo. The Tieke cries 
Chorus. Tieke. 

Solo. A belly only, 
Chorus. Fork it out, fork it out ! 

Solo. Keep in the path, 
Chorus. Fork it out !

Cheerily, men ! 
It's the man-catcher, 
Cheerily, men ! 
Give this way, and carry it, 
Cheerily, men ! 
But whither carry it ? 
Cheerily, men ! 
Ah ! to the root, 
Root of Tu. 
Solo. O wind, 
Chorus. Pull away. 

Solo. Pull onwards the root, 
Chorus. Root of Tu." 
Kiwi, Moho, and Tieke are names of birds.

The Maories also possess a similar kind of song to the 
natives of the Paumotu group, Polynesia, and those of the 
Sandwich Islands, namely, the Song of Welcome. The 
turtle-fishers of the Fiji Islands have also this Song of 
Welcome when they return from the fisheries. If they 
have been successful, they come shouting songs of triumph, 
and the women come down to the shore to meet them 
also singing, and sometimes as an additional mark of joy 
they pelt a quantity of bitter oranges at their respective 
husbands, sons, and brothers. On the contrary, if they 
have not met with success, they have a sort of chant of the 
most solemn nature which is used.

Respecting the signs employed in the notation of this song, 
which I am quoting from Carl Engel's most valuable 
work on " National Music," it must be observed that J $ is 
meant to raise a note a quarter-tone ; J $ raises it a 
semitone, as does our single sharp ; | # raises it three 
quarter-tones. The same with flats : J t? is meant to lower 
a note a quarter-tone ; and so on. The sign ^ is used to 
indicate that the voice is to glide from one interval to 
another, much as when the finger is drawn over the violin 
string to a certain distance. Mr. Davies, who is responsible 
for the foregoing notation, has made a study of the Maories 
for some twenty years, and may therefore, I think, be re- 



320 Music OF THE WATERS. 

lied upon for authentic information concerning them. He 
pronounces them to be gifted with a remarkably fine ear 
for distinguishing quarter-tones ; they are to be congratu- 
lated on the intelligence, that one would think must be 
characteristic of them, to enable them to become familiar 
with what seems to us such a difficult style of notation ; 
and yet the Maories are as much addicted to cannibalism 
as the natives of the Marquesas Archipelago, with the 
exception, of course, of those who .have come under the 
influence of European civilization and Christianity. 

Every circumstance in the life of a native of New Zealand 
has a song dedicated to the season ; thus in fishing, canoe 
and house-building, planting, sowing, reaping, felling 
timber, paddling canoes, births, marriages, and deaths, 
peace and war, each has its characteristic chant, accom- 
panied by a chorus. The chants are simple, and the 
musical subjects few, but the words embodying the scanty 
musical scores are innumerable. Poetical composition is 
not practised, detached sentences in prose forming the 
groundwork for the music, which are compositions without 
the attempt at finish as among Europeans, yet a step 
nearer to a musical piece than the chant of a recitative can 
be pronounced. 

Many complaints are made of the ill-conduct of the 
American, French, and English seamen at the Bay of 
Islands, but, says Mr. J. S. Polack, in his " Manners and 
Customs of the New Zealanders," " we would inquire of 
those seeming philanthropists, are our ports in Great Britain 
kept wholly immaculate ? And will the Jack Tar of Ports- 
mouth repudiate his lass or his glass, or will the French 
matelot at Nantes or Bordeaux cease his song, and refuse 
to join in quaffing the rich juices afforded by the vintage 
of the Garonne, or will the Yankee sailor of Massachusetts, 
or the Bucksin of ' ole Virginny,' fail less to kick at the 
dispiriting measures of the select, social, temporal teeto- 
talers," who, he avers, would drive all sociability into " an 
eternal everlasting fix." 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



321 



Some hundreds of natives are at the present 
moment manning ships sailing under the British, French^ 
and American flags, and are regarded by unbiassed persons 
equal in their duties to European seamen, and as effective 
in ability and strength, while dieting on similar provisions. 
The New Zealand seaman may now be found in every 
part of the globe under the frozen zones of the north and 
south, and the torrid latitudes east and west, steering at 
night and alone on deck the full-freighted ship, amid the 
pathless waters, joining the hilarity of his brother-seamen, 
and equally watchful aloft when danger may approach, and 
may be said to present the nearest approach to a British 
tar beyond any other nation of which we know. 



ICELAND. 

Mr. Baring Gould, in his volume, "Iceland, its Scenes and 
Sagas," gives one or two specimens of genuine Icelandic 
melody. He says that all the songs were in Icelandic, 
but the melodies were mostly Danish ; " God Save the 
Queen " and " Beautiful Star " were both set to Icelandic 
words, and descriptive of the glories of the island. I give 
the Icelandic National Hymn :

The hymn which follows is one that is frequently used 
by the natives. It is a genuine Icelandic melody : 




The Esquimaux have two sorts of boats or canoes, the 
kia or man's boat, and the oomiak or woman's boat ; this 
latter is the more perfect vessel of the two, as it is often 
used for the transport of more than one person and 
also for the conveyance of luggage. It can scarcely be 
said to be a comfortable vessel though. The women 
paddle their own canoe, but an old man generally steers 
the oomiak. He is selected because of his age, and 
though considered sufficiently able to direct the woman's 
canoe, is supposed to be too old for the kia or man's 
boat. I believe it is no uncommon thing for this old 
Charon to fling a knife, harpoon, or even a seal-hook at 
the ladies if they should neglect their paddling. When I 
read this in Wood's "Natural History of Man," it struck me 
as evidence of a very poor spirit in the fair sex of those 
northern shores, to allow themselves to be so treated by 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



323 



one old man amongst perhaps a crew of six or eight 
women in mid-ocean. An Englishman, and certainly not 
an old one, would never be allowed a repetition of 
such amiable gallantry in a boatful of his country- 
women. One attempt at throwing a harpoon or knife 
and he would have laid down his steering-gear for ever, 
and gone to keep company with the fishes. 



BOAT-SONGS OF THE SAMOAN AND 
TONGA ISLANDERS. 

A gentleman attached to the United States Exploring 
Expedition wrote down the following boat-songs of the 
Samoan or Navigators' Islanders. He says : " The natives, 
owing to their communication with the Tonga or Friendly 
Isles, have some knowledge of Captain Cook, and a trans- 
lation of the first of the boat-songs would run thus : 

' Cook tells you, Pull away ; 
I will do so, and so must you.' 

In their trips from town to town they are generally on 
parties of pleasure termed Malanga, and are frequently to 
be met with singing their boat-songs."

The music of the Tonga Islands bears a great resem- 
blance to the Samoan ; I have therefore included a few 
remarks on it. The following is a song used by the 
natives of Tonga-taboo, when advancing in a boat with 
their chief. The traveller who noted this song mentions 
that he wrote it exactly as he heard it, with the bass and 
harmony. It is to be inferred that it is native, for the 
Tongese never had foreign music of any kind taught 
them.

The Tonga Islanders possess several songs descriptive

325 



of historical occurrences. One of these is commemorative of 
the principal events that happened during Captain Cook's 
visit, and which, excepting a little exaggeration, is tolerably 
correct. 

The Tongese have many short songs, which they call 
Tow Alo y and sing when they are paddling their canoes, 
the strokes of the paddle being coincident with the cadence 
of the tune. They are very frequently sung on leaving 
Vavaoo, whilst paddling out of the inlet. The following 
is an example of the words and an English translation : 



ENGLISH VERSION. 
Alas ! we are entering upon our 

voyage, 

By leaving Moonga-lafa and Talow ! 
Anxious am I to stay ; who can wish 

to go? 
Departing from Vavaoo and her 

neighbouring isles, 
And Licoo-one, and Vaoo-aca, 
The road of springs near Maccapapa, 

Mataloco and the myrtle plain, 
The cave of Tootaw-i, the beach of 

Mofooee, 
No longer can I stand upon high 

places 
And look downwards on the fleet of 

small canoes. 
We must leave the crimson gnatoo 

of Tlaf6oloohow, 
To wear the coarser mats of Toofooa 

and Kaoo ! 

Most of their song-words are in the Samoan language. 
The following is a specimen of the paddling-songs, which 
really form the principal water-music of the Tonga 
Islands :

THE INDIANS OF NORTH-WEST 
AMERICA. 

Amongst the many and varied kinds of music and song- 
verses that have come under my notice since I entered 
upon the task of collecting the " Music of the Waters," 
there is no specimen of notation that has struck me as 
being so entirely original, and, if I may use the word, so 
comical, as those of the Indians, as described by Max 
Miiller in the chapter devoted to the " Popol Vuk," in the 
first volume of his " Chips from a German Workshop." 
I mean the war-songs and love-songs in the picture- 
writing, and which were really supposed to be perfectly 
intelligible to all the tribes. What should we, enlightened 
mortals of this nineteenth century, make of the following, 
for instance ? 

1. Figure representing a god (monedo) endowed with 
magic power. 

2. Figure beating the drum and singing ; lines from his 
mouth. 

3. Figure surrounded by a secret lodge. 

4. Two bodies joined with one continuous arm. 

5. A woman on an island. 

6. A woman asleep ; lines from his ear towards her. 

7. A red heart in a circle. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 



327 



The interpretation is 

1. It is my form and person that make me great. 

2. Hear the voice of my song, it is my voice. 

3. I shield myself with secret coverings. 

4. All your thoughts are known to me, blush ! 

5. I could draw you hence were you ever so far. 

6. Though you were on the other hemisphere 

7. I speak to your naked heart. 

I can picture the blank amazement of the modern sailor 
if asked to convey his sentiments to " Kate " or " Nancy " 
in some such way, and Nancy's bewilderment if he suc- 
ceeded in so doing; and yet I may almost say, that the 
foregoing is a specimen of an American-Indian sea- 
song, for it was chiefly of the sea and by the sea that 
these tribes lived. Max Miiller adds, " All we can say is, 
that if the Indians can read this writing, they are greater 
adepts in the mysteries of love than the judges of the old 
cours & amour. But it is much more likely that these 
war-songs and love-songs are known to the people 
beforehand, and that their writings are only meant to 
revive what exists in the memory of the reader. It is a 
kind of mnemonic writing, and it has been used by 
missionaries for similar purposes, and with considerable 
success." 

Captain Dixon gives the notes of the following 
song, which he says he often heard whilst in Norfolk 
Sound :

The North- American Indians have quite a notion of 
harmony, if one may judge by these specimens of their 
music. Almost all the inhabitants of that part of the 
world have a remarkable capacity for music. The song 
which follows is sung by the traders when nearing a 
strange crew. The chief usually approaches first, singing 
and crossing his arms, as a sign of friendship.

NEGRO SONGS OF WESTERN AFRICA. 

" Most negro tribes appear to possess a remarkably keen 
susceptibility for rhythmical regularity. This is evident 
from their dances with the usual accompaniment of drums 
and other instruments of percussion, executed with the 
greatest possible precision. Their songs, however, often 
consist of merely short melodies, which, like the recitative, 
do not possess a strictly defined symmetrical construction. 
The cause of this may be attributed to the circumstance 
that the negroes on many occasions are in the habit of im- 
provising the words of their songs, and that the melodies 
must therefore continually undergo slight modifications 
demanded by the improvised poetry, which, as regards the 
number of the syllables, as well as the metre in general, is 
not always constructed precisely after the same rule, but 
alters according to the momentary inventions of the im- 
provisator." 2 This " Serere " air which follows is a boat- 
song, and is sung by the crew while rowing. It has 
been noticed that the rowing is performed in strict time 
with the song. The letters R above the stave show the 
moment when the oars are raised, and the letters L denote 
their being lowered into the water. This air, therefore, is 
most strictly regular as to rhythm. Whatever may be the 
interior changes from triple to common measure, the time 
which the respective changes consume must be equal, for 
what can be more isochronous than the movement of the 
oars of a well-trained boat's-crew ! Another very rhyth- 
mical air is the following Mandingo one :

CREOLE WATER-SONGS. 

Mr. George W. Cable, writing in the Century Magazine, 
April, 1886, on Creole slave-songs, devotes a page to the 
songs of the chase and of the boat. Of these latter he has 
most courteously allowed me to make use. He says " that 
the circumstances which produced these songs have dis- 
appeared. Travelling in Louisiana used only to be by 
water. Every planter had his boat and skilled crew of 
black oarsmen. The throb of their song measured the 
sweep of the oars, and as their bare or turbaned heads and 
shining bodies bowed forward and straightened back in 
ceaseless alternation, their strong voices chanted the praise 
of the silent, broad- hatted master, who sat in the stern. 
Now and then a line would be interjected in manly boast 
of their own brawn, and often the praise of the master 
softened off into tender laudations of the charms of some 
black or tawny Zilie, Zabette, or Zalli" The following 
are a few stanzas of one of the rowing-songs : 



Music OF THE WATEES. 



331 



" Sing, lads, our master bids us sing, 

For master cry out loud and strong. 
The water with the long oar strike, 
Sing, lads, and let us haste along. 

" Tis for our master we will sing, 

We'll sing for our young mistresses, 
And sweethearts we must not forget, 
Zoe, Mertente, Zabelle, Louish. 

" Sing, fellows, for our own true loves, 
My lottery prize ! Zoe, my belle ! 
She's like a wild young doe, she knows 
The way to jump and dance so well ! 

" Black diamonds are her bright, black eyes, 

Her teeth are lilies white ; 
Sing, fellows, for my true love, and 
The water with the long oar strike. 

" See ! see the town ! hurrah ! hurrah ! 

Master returns in pleasant mood ; 
He's going to treat his boys all round, 
Hurrah ! hurrah for master good ! " 

Another song quoted is of wood and water, though 
only the latter is mentioned. It is a " Runaway's Song of 
Defiance " : 

" General Florido ! indeed, fo' true dey can't catch me. 
General Florido ! indeed, fo' true dey can't catch me." 

" Dey got one schooner out at sea, 
Dey got one schooner out at sea. 
Indeed, fo' true dey can't catch me."

SUPERSTITIONS, CUSTOMS, AND WATER- 
LEGENDS OF THE SEA, RIVERS, 
AND LAKES. 



KNOWLEDGE is, of course, to superstition as light is to darkness; still 
some nations endowed with a lively imagination, although they are 
much advanced in mental development, cling to the superstitions of 
their forefathers, since the superstitions accord with their poetical 
conceptions, or are endeared to them by associations which pleasantly 
engage the imaginative faculties. 



Anon you shall hear a hog grunt, a calf bleat, and an ass bray, 
Because it is Saint Peter's holiday." 

MARLOWE'S Faustus. 



' Bird whom I welcomed while the sailors cursed." 

THEODORE WATTS' Ode to Mother Carey's Chicken. 



SAILORS' SUPERSTITIONS. 

" A COMPARATIVE investigation of the superstitions rife 
amongst the different sailors of the world would result in 
a certain conclusion that there is but little variety in them. 
Certain objects, certain signs, and certain persons inspire 
Jack with an idea of the supernatural, whether European, 
Asiatic, or American. The Portsmouth tar, the Normandy 
matelot, the German seaman, and the Italian fisherman, 
all share in common with the Nile boatman, the Chinese 
waterman, and the Yankee blue-jacket, the fears that have 
been handed down from their respective marine ancestors 
for generations. Sailors, although usually the bravest 
men, have from time immemorial been noted for their 
credulity, and every literature contains evidence of the 
multiplicity of their superstitions, and of the tenacity with 
which they cling to them. It may be questioned, how- 
ever, whether as a class they are really more superstitious 
than landsmen, the only difference perhaps being that their 
isolation, consequent from their connection with the sea, 
gives them a distinctive character, which otherwise they 
would not possess. Their history, too, dating from the 
most remote period in the annals of the world, has natu- 
rally invested them with a peculiar interest in this and 
other countries. And hence we find scattered here and 
there many a curious account recorded by travellers of 
their customs and peculiarities, to give a detailed resume 
of which would occupy a volume of considerable size. 
Indeed, as Reginald Scott has truly remarked in his 
' Discovery of Witchcraft,' innumerable are the reports of 



336 Music OF THE WATERS. 

accidents unto such as frequent the seas as fishermen and 
sailors, who discourse of noises, flashes, shadows, echoes, 
and other visible appearances nightly seen and heard upon 
the surface of the water." 1 

Amongst the animals which the sailor considers as 
omens of good or ill-luck are cats, hares, rats, porpoises, 
or sea-hogs. Certain birds also come under this category, 
the Stormy Petrel, the great auk, the kingfisher, and the 
sea-gull. 

The cat is the object of many an odd belief. In the 
neighbourhood of Scarborough, for instance, we are told 
how a few years ago sailors' wives were in the habit of 
keeping black cats to ensure the safety of their husbands 
at sea ; black cats thus increased in value to such an extent, 
that few could afford the luxury of them. Many sailors 
object to having cats on board, and if one happens to be 
more frisky than usual, they have a saying that " the cat 
has got a gale of wind in her tail." Also a firm notion 
exists amongst seamen, that the throwing of a cat over- 
board will bring on a storm. A dead hare on board a ship is 
considered a sign of an approaching hurricane, and Cornish 
fishermen (than whom no more superstitious set of men 
exist) declare that a white hare seen about the quays at 
night indicates that there will be rough weather. The 
fisherman of Filey, like the Japanese sailor, hesitates to go 
to sea on any day when he has encountered a pig early in 
the morning. The blue-jackets of the " Empire of the 
Rising Sun," however, have an equal objection to meeting 
a priest previous to setting out upon a voyage. Piggie is 
an object of aversion to more seafaring people than the 
Filey fishermen and Japanese sailors ; there is scarcely a 
book or article on the superstitions of the sea that I have 
read, that does not allude to his Jonah-like propensities. 
As to rats, we all well know of their connection with 
ships. Shakespeare, in the most nautical of his plays, 
<( The Tempest," says, in speaking of the vessel in which 
1 Extract from the Leisure Hour. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 337 

Prospero and Miranda had been placed with a view to their 
destruction : 

" The very rats 
Instinctively had quit it." 

It is said that rats leave a ship in harbour, previous to 
its being lost at sea. Sometimes there is a reason for this 
sudden desertion, as in the case of the cunning Welsh 
captain whose ship was infested with them. He was lying 
in the Mersey, and learning that there was a vessel laden 
with cheese in the basin, he drew alongside of her at dusk, 
left all his hatches open, and when the rats were safely on 
board of that to them Eldorado cheese-laden ship, he 
moved off. 

With regard to birds the Stormy Petrel, as- its name 
betokens, presages bad weather ; the great auk never 
wanders beyond soundings, and thus taking their clue 
from him the sailors know that land is not far off. Of the 
kingfisher it used to be said, that whilst this bird was 
hatching her eggs, the sea remained so calm that the period 
became known as the halcyon days. The Scotch say of 
the sea-gulls : 

" Sea-gull, sea-gull, sit on the sand, 
It's never good weather when you're on the land/' 

Bad weather may always be looked for whenever these 
birds leave the open sea and hover near the shore. The 
sea-legends and superstitions that have to do with birds 
are of very ancient date. Aristophanes tells us how the 
Greek sailors heeded their signs : 

" From birds, in sailing, men instructions take, 
Now lie in port, now sail, and profit make." 

The intense dread which sailors and fishermen have of 
the dead is a wide-spread one amongst all nations, and 
the horror of the Chinese sailor, when asked to carry a 
corpse on board, is shared by bis brother blue-jackets on 
every sea ; they say the sea cannot digest the crudity of a 

z 



338 Music OF THE WATERS. 

dead body, it being a due debt to be interred where it 
lieth, and a ship cannot abide to be made a bier of. 

" On certain parts of the coast in Cornwall, sailors dread 
walking at night near those portions of the shore where 
there have been many wrecks, for they firmly believe that 
the souls of drowned sailors haunt such localities, and 
further affirm that the calling of the dead has frequently 
been heard. Indeed at night-time, on the approach of a 
tempest, these callings are declared to be of common occur- 
rence, and many a sailor positively asserts that he has heard 
the voices of the dead sailors * hailing their own names.' " l 

Friday is considered by the sailors as an unlucky day 
to set sail upon or begin any work. One cannot wonder 
at the prevalence of this idea amongst them, seeing how 
deeply-rooted it has become amongst all classes and 
nations ; but we may query the wisdom of a sneeze to 
the left or the right side, at the moment of embarking, 
having any effect upon the voyage being favourable or 
otherwise. It is also considered very unlucky if any one 
accidentally numbers the sailors on board, or to ask Scotch 
sailors or fishermen before they start on a journey where 
they are bound for ! And to point with the finger to a 
ship when at sea is most disastrous ; the whole hand 
should be raised up to counteract the evil consequences. 
It is a bad sign if a water-bucket or a mop is lost, and no 
one must cut his hair or nails at sea, except during a 
storm ; thus a calm voyage would return a crew whose 
fingers would be formidable weapons to encounter, and 
whose locks would be suggestive of Rip Van Winkle or 
Robinson Crusoe. 

Whistling is thought very unlucky by sailors, as it is 
supposed to raise an unfavourable wind. This superstition 
is, I fancy, to be traced to the practice of whistling for 
winds, common to many nations in days gone by, which 
used to exist, and which I have elsewhere mentioned. A 
whistling woman is a bete noire to Jack. 

1 Extract from the Leisure Hour. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 339 

The moon and clouds also play an important part in a 
sailor's life, and the notion that the weather changes with 
the moon's quarters is firmly implanted in them. 

" I saw the new moon late yester-e'en, 
With the old moon in her arm ; 
And if we go to sea, master, 
I fear we'll come to harm." 

This used to be a favourite rhyme in the sixteenth 
century. 

Seamen find it convenient to express many important 
facts in rhymes, and a few of the more prominent are here 
given : 

" The evening gray and morning red, 
Put on your hat or you'll wet your head." 

" When the wind shifts against the sun, 
Trust it not, for it will run." 

" When the sun sets in the clear, 
An easterly wind you need not fear." 

" The evening red and morning gray, 
Are sure signs of a fine day ; 

But the evening gray and morning red 
Make the sailor shake his head." 

Adverting to the barometer : 

"First rise, after low, 

Indicates a stronger blow." 
Also- 

" Long foretold, long last ; 
Short notice, soon past." 

To which may be added : 

" In squalls, 

When the rain's before the wind, 
Halyards, sheets, and braces mind." 

Z 2 



340 MUSIC OF THE WATERS; 

And- 

" When the wind's before the rain, 
Soon you may make sail again." 

Also speaking generally : 

" When the glass falls low 
Prepare for a blow, 
When it rises high 
Let all your kites fly." 

" A rainbow in the morning, 
Sailors take warning ; 
A rainbow at night 
Is the sailors' delight." 

In fact there is no end to the superstitions that exist, or 
perhaps I should say, existed among sailors ; indeed, after 
searching through the works which treat of these, one 
almost wonders at the light-heartedness characteristic of 
the blue-jackets when one thinks of the burden laid upon 
them through them. 

RELIGIOUS CEREMONIES. 

The fishermen of Clovelly were formerly in the habit of 
inaugurating the commencement of the herring-fishing 
season by attending a special service at the church ; 
the I07th Psalm being substituted for the Psalm of the 
day, and the gospel of the fifth Sunday after Trinity 
being read on the occasion. The old Hundredth Psalm, 
too, was sung by all the fishermen before the general 
thanksgiving, and after it came that unique prayer known 
as the Clovelly Fishermen's Prayer, which begins "Al- 
mighty and loving Father, Thou rulest in the heaven, in 
the earth, in the sea, and in all deep places." The Clovelly 
fishermen's example is not often followed ; there are 
many places where, like the herring-fishers of Marken 
(Holland), the little flotilla sails on a Sunday evening. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 341 

Many of the fishing community are of a decidedly 
religious character, thus following the example of their 
patron saint, St. Peter. Oftentimes on a summer's evening, 
off the Cornish coast, one may hear the fishermen engaged 
in singing hymns of praise. Like the Dutch seafaring 
men, these Cornish men are most fervent in their devotions ; 
the rugged, lonely, perilous lives they lead being responsible 
for the solemnity of their bearing/The Breton and 
Norman fishermen are also very God-fearing people. 

The herring fishery in the Isle of Man is the staple 
industry of the place the Manx sea-harvest it is called. 
Before the men set off for the fishing a service is held, and 
to the verse in the Church Litany, " That it may please 
Thee to give and preserve to our use the kindly fruits 
of the earth, so as in due time we may enjoy them," is 
added, "and restore and continue to us the blessings of 
the sea." Bishop Wilson had this supplemented in the 
Manx Book of Common Prayer, in 1779. Also, before 
shooting the nets, at a sign from the master of the boat, 
every man goes down upon his knees, and with his head 
uncovered asks that a blessing may be upon the fishing. 
They are a thoroughly devout people, these silent, earnest, 
shrewd Manx fishermen, and there is a great deal to interest 
one in their sayings and doings. For instance, a Manx 
fisherman counts 124 fish to the hundred, he adds three to 
every hundred (120) which he distinguishes by the name 
of " warp," and then he throws in a single herring which 
he calls " tally," thus making 124. They have some queer 
proverbs about herrings. They are delicate fish and very 
easily killed ; when they are taken out of the water they 
give a peculiar squeak, and die thus, " As dead as a 
herring " is a favourite saying, and as they are caught by 
the gills in the meshes of the net, with all their heads 
hanging in the same direction, " Every herring must hang 
by his own gill." Like the Zetland fishermen, the Manx 
have a toast, " Life to man and death to fish " (Manx) 
" Bioys da dooinne as baase da eeast." 



342 Music OF THE WATERS. 

A belief in the supernatural is strongly rooted in the 
minds of the sea-going community ; amongst necromantic 
agencies, bells occupy a very prominent place. Occasion- 
ally, during a hurricane, the death-bell is clearly heard 
borne along the angry billows ; a superstition alluded to 
by Sir Walter Scott : 

" And the belfrie rang, 
And the sea-maid sang, 
The dirge of lovely Rosabelle." 

Southey, in his famous ballad of the " Inchcape Bell," has 
immortalized one of these bell legends. Once on the 
sands near Blackpool, out at sea, stood the church of 
Kilgrimal, now completely submerged ; wanderers near this 
spot, however, are still said from time to time to be terri- 
fied by the dismal chimes of the bells as they send forth 
their doleful peals over the murmuring sea. The people 
of Pembroke, too, hear a sunken bell ring from its watery 
grave when a storm is rising. It is supposed to be the 
great bell of St. David's, Pembrokeshire, which was carried 
off during the Cromwellian wars ; the robbers managed to 
get it on board ship, but in passing through Ramsey Sound 
the vessel was wrecked a direct result, the superstitious 
said, of profanely treating the bell. Denmark has many of 
these legends. There is one at Gossingen about two bells 
which were ordered to be cast in the town of Lubeck. 
These bells were brought by sea to Schleimunde ; but, as 
ill-luck would have it, one of them fell into the sea and 
was lost. From that day, whenever the remaining bell is 
being rung, it distinctly proclaims " My companion lies in 
the Schleimunde." 

During tempests at Malta it is usual to ring all the bells 
in the Roman Catholic churches for an hour, that the 
wind may cease and the sea be calmed. This custom also 
prevails in Sicily and Sardinia. There is a Cornish legend 
that the bells of Bottreaux church were sent by ship, but 
when the vessel was in sight of the town, the blasphemy

343 



of the captain was punished by the loss of his ship. The 
bells are supposed to lie in the bay and announce by 
strange sounds the approach of a storm. 

The late Henry Smart has set to music the legend of the 
town of" Vineta," on the Baltic once, it is said, the greatest 
emporium in the north of Europe several times destroyed 
and built up again, till in 1183, it was upheaved by an 
earthquake and swallowed by a flood. The ruins of Vineta 
are popularly believed to be visible on certain days, and 
their bells audible below the waves, between the coast of 
Pomerania and the island of Rugen. By the kind permis- 
sion of Messrs. Novello, Ewer, and Co., I am enabled to 
give the air of this most beautiful song, and the words 
which are from the Schleswig-Holstein poetry : 




From the sea's deep hoi- low faint - ly peal

" And the boatman who at twilight hour . . . 

Once that magic vision shall have seen, 
Heedless how the crags may round him lour, 
Ever more will haunt the charmed scene. 

" From the heart's deep hollow faintly pealing, 

Far I hear those bell -notes sad and slow, 
Ah ! a wild and wond'rous tale revealing 

Of the drowned wreck of love below. 
There a world in loveliness decaying, 

Lingers yet in beauty ere it die ; 
Phantom forms across my senses playing, 

Flash like golden fire-flakes from the sky. 
Lights are gleaming, fairy bells are ringing, 

And I long to plunge and wander free, 
Where I hear the angel voices singing 

In those ancient towers below the sea, 

In those ancient towers below the sea." 



MUSICAL SOUNDS AND FISH. 

An Italian savant has discovered a new and simple 
method of catching fish ; the bait is a musical one. The 
Gazetta del Popolo says, "As we all know, the sense of 
hearing is extraordinarily developed in fish ; it appears that 
while the slightest noise scatters them in all directions, a 
musical note, especially that produced by the human voice, 
attracts them ; on hearing it they stop suddenly in their 
course. Signer Saretti discovering this fact, embarked one 
morning on the Lake of Geneva with a party of friends. 
He possesses a very fine deep bass voice, and striking up a 



Music OF THE WATEES. 345 

national song he proved to his astonished companions the 
truth of his assertions. They were able by means of an 
aquascope to perceive the eagerness with which the 
piscine population gathered around the little boat. Casting 
over the nets they had brought, they instantly made such 
a catch as has rarely, if ever, been known on the lake, and 
they may be said indeed to have made another miraculous 
draught of fishes." 

Fish again are charged with being voiceless, but how 
then about the gurnard that pipes, the diodon that grunts, 
and the others that drum and whistle and play on Jew's 
harps ? The legend that they were caught in Egypt by 
singing to them is not without its plausibility. " Fishes, 
though little, have very long ears " is an old Chinese 
proverb ; and to this day, on the Danube, men hang little 
bells to their nets to attract fish. In Japan the same fish 
are summoned to dinner by melodious gongs. In India 
we have seen them called up out of the muddy depths 
of the river at Dholpore by the ringing of a handbell J 
and from the abbey in Belgium, where the carp answer 
at once to the whistle of the monks who feed them, right 
away to Otaheite, where the chiefs have pet eels which 
they whistle to the surface, the same belief in the sym- 
pathy of fish with musical sounds will on inquiry be found 
prevailing. "Dull as a mullet" was a Roman proverb, 
yet the very men who quoted it, prided themselves on the 
docility, sensitiveness to sound, and personal attachment 
of their favourite mullets. We are inclined, therefore, to 
think that the finned folk have been somewhat calum- 
niated ; a grudge, it is possible, has been borne against the 
fish, under the idea that they escaped the deluge. 

In Chamber*? Journal (July 3rd, 1886) there appeared 
a very interesting article entitled " Musical Sand." The 
existence of musical or sonorous sand is not much known, 
although such sand appears to occur in localities widely 
distributed over the earth's surface. There is the so-called 
" Singing Beach " at Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, 



346 Music OF THE WATERS. 

and a beach of sonorous sand at Eigg, and also in the 
Hebrides. 

Specimens of sonorous sand are to be found in the 
island of Bornholm, Denmark ; Colberg, Prussia ; and 
Kanai, Hawaii Islands. Old Chinese chronicles mention 
sonorous sand as occurring in the desert of Lob-Nor. 
Marco Polo narrates superstitions concerning it, and the 
Emperor Baber refers to a locality in Afghanistan where 
it is found. Careful search in literature shows that allusions 
to this phenomenon are scattered sparingly through writ- 
ings of a thousand years. 

The character of the sounds obtained by friction on the 
beach is decidedly musical. The shrillness and lowness of 
note depend chiefly on the quantity of sand disturbed. By 
plunging both hands into the sand and bringing them 
together quickly, a tone is heard, the dominant note of 
which is B below the treble stave. By stroking the sand 
nearer the surface and with less force, very high notes were 
heard confused ; they ranged from E, fourth space treble 
clef, to B above the stave. By rubbing firmly and briskly 
a double handful of the sand, several notes on a rising scale 
were heard. The ear received an impression something 
like that formed by sliding a finger up a violin-string at 
the same time that the bow is drawn. 

Sonorous and mute sand occur in the beach closely ad- 
joining, but they cannot be distinguished by the eye ; 
friction alone determines the difference. 

The phenomenon is well worthy of investigation, and no 
light seems as yet to have been thrown on its cause, nor 
any progress made towards the solution of the mystery of 
the difference between mute and musical sand. 

" Now lay thine ear against this golden sand, 
And thou shalt hear the music of the sea, 
Those hollow tunes it p!ays against the land, 
Is't not a rich and wondrous melody ? 
I have lain hours, and fancied in its tone 
I heard the languages of ages gone.'*

ROMANCES OF THE MERMAIDS. 

"The sighs that from thy seamen pass 

Might set a fleet a-sail ; 

And the faces that look in the mermaid's glass 
Are as long as the mermaid's tail." 

RICHARD GARNETT. 

MORVA OR MORVETH (SEA-DAUGHTERS). 

The intimate connection between the inhabitants of 
Brittany, of Cornwall, and of Wales, would appear to lead 
to the conclusion that the Breton word Morverch, or mer- 
maid, had much to do with the naming of the Cornish 
parish of Morva (signifying Locus maritimus, a place near 
the sea). The church of Morva, like most of the churches 
on the coast of Cornwall, was built by and for fishermen, to 
whom the superstitions of mermen and " merry-maids " 
had the familiarity of a creed. 

Whether the mermaids belong to the ^Egean Sea, or the 
Mediterranean, the Pacific, or the Atlantic, we may rest as- 
sured their mission is ever the same to lure to destruction, 
by the marvellous beauty of their persons, and by the 
bewitching songs " plaintive as the waves." Mermaids are 
but rarely considered as benefactors. Legends and tales 
of them generally associate them with some catastrophe. 

Mr. Robert Hunt, in his " Popular Romances of the West 
of England ; or, the Drolls, Traditions, and Superstitions of 
old Cornwall," devotes a chapter to tales of the Cornish 
mermaids ; there is one, " The Mermaid's Rock," which I 
quote, as it is very short, very much to the point, and 
certainly may be taken as a type of mermaid romance in 
general : 

" To the westward of the beautiful Cove of Lemorna is a 
rock which has through all time borne the above name. 
There exists the popular fancy of a lady showing herself 
here previous to a storm with, of course, the invariable 
comb and glass. She is said to have been heard singing 



348 Music OF THE WATEES. 

most plaintively before a wreck, and that, all along the 
shore, the spirits have echoed her in low moaning voices. 
Young men are said to have swam off to the rock, lured by 
the songs which they heard, but they have never returned" 
a peculiarity of young men who endeavour to prosecute 
their acquaintance with mermaids further than viewing 
them from a safe and enchanted distance. Appended to 
this little story in Mr. Hunt's volume, there is a note of 
explanation, which says, " The undulations of the air, 
travelling with more rapidity than the currents, reach our 
shores long before the tempest by which they have been 
established in the centre of the Atlantic, and by producing 
a low moaning sound, * the soughing of the wind,' predi- 
cates the storms." 

There is a longer tale, entitled " The Mermaid's Venge- 
ance," in the same chapter, which introduces several songs ; 
one is sung by the heroine, evidently a very cruel mermaid, 
to the hero, Walter by name, whom she holds by the hair 
of his head : 

" Come away, come away 
O'er the waters wild. 
Our earth-born child 
Died this day, died this day. 

Come away, come away 
The tempest loud 
Weaves the shroud 
For him who did betray. 

Come away, come away 

Beneath the wave 

Lieth the grave 

Of him we slay, him we slay. 

Come away, come away 

He shall not rest 

In earth's own breast, 

For many a day, many a day. 



Music OF THE WATEES. 349 

Come away, come away 

By billows tost 

From coast to coast, 

Like deserted boat 

His corse shall float, 

Around the bay, around the bay." 

That their coiffure is a matter of great we might almost 
say, paramount importance to these water-fairies one can- 
not doubt ; the faithful chronicler of their doings would as 
soon think of representing a soldier without his sword, or 
a fish without a tail, as a mermaid minus her comb and 
glass. Amongst the English sailors' songs, I have men- 
tioned one known as " The Mermaid ;" it is a very 
humorous description of the direful fate of a young sailor 
who fell in with one, and who was doomed to pass the 
rest of his days with this green-haired beauty "at the 
bottom of the deep blue sea." 

NECKS. 

The necks or water-spirits are renowned for their love 
and talent for music. There exist, people say, various 
kinds of these interesting creatures. The Swedes relate 
wonderful stories respecting the marvellous harp-playing 
of a neck called Stromkarl, who generally prefers the 
vicinity of water-mills and cascades for his abode. 

The neck or nicker has become quite a stranger in 
England. Some Englishmen, however, take care to pre- 
serve his name, applying it to a spirit of another element 
than water, and every one knows at once whom they mean 
when they speak of Old Nick. Like the sirens and the 
mermaids, the female neck enchants youths with sweet 
music, and draws them down into the water. In the Greek 
mythology, Hylas, a king's son, is commemorated as 
having been drawn into the water by nymphs enamoured 
of the beautiful youth. 

The Scandinavian god, Odin, the originator of magic 



350 Music OF THE WATERS. 

songs, is mentioned as the ruler of the sea, and as such he 
had the name of Nikarr. In the depth of the sea he 
played the harp with his subordinate spirits, who occasion- 
ally came up to the surface of the water to teach some 
favourite mortal their wonderful instrument. 

It is a suggestive fact that several nations in different 
parts of the world possess an ancient tradition, according 
to which some harp-like instrument was originally derived 
from the water. 

Another Scandinavian water- deity was Herta, or the 
Storm-compeller, according to tradition, a goddess who 
presided over storms. 

" What can be more sweet to see 
Than the sailor's agony ? 
While around the wild waves roar, 
And lash with furious rage the shore." 

The Drottwich canal (Worcestershire), in passing through 
Salwarpe, is said to have cut off a slice of a large, old, half- 
timbered structure, supposed to have been formerly a 
mansion-house; and in revenge for this act of mutilation, 
the ghost of a former occupier revisits his old haunts, 
affrights the domestics, and may be seen on dark nights, 
with deprecatory aspect, to glide down the embankment 
and suicidally commit himself to the waters below. 

" The changes which have taken place in the sea-life 
cannot be wholly restricted to the transformations of the 
ship-building yard. There is a mighty difference, indeed, 
between the line-of-battle ship of fifty years ago and the 
armour-clad of to-day between the Atlantic passenger 
clippers of which Fennimore Cooper wrote and the iron 
mail-steamers which have succeeded them ; but there are 
changes in other maritime directions fully as remarkable, 
though, perhaps, not so deeply accentuated to the shore 
gaze. Where are the old customs of the ocean ? Whither 
has fled the traditionary character of the sailor ? His 
canvas remains ; he still has his topsails, albeit halved, 



Music OF T&E WATERS. 351 

to hoist, his topgallant-sails to sheet home, his royals to 
set ; spite of steam, there are still scores of the old-fashioned 
windlasses for him to carol his hurricane songs over ; still 
scores of the old-fashioned capstans to twist round, ' drunk, 
monotonous, and melodious ; ' davits at which he may 
cast his anchor, as did his forefathers ; forecastles as clammy 
as the most reeking of the holes in which the Jacks of 
other days lay snoring, with purple faces, in clouds of cock- 
roaches. But, for all that, it will not do to pretend that 
the sailor is what he was. I do not speak of the carica- 
tures of the fictionist the monstrous pigtailed figures with 
lanthorn jaws, broken teeth, wooden legs, and bloodshot 
eyes ; the race of Hatchways, Trunnions, and Pipses, who 
stagger, full of drink and * language/ in dismal procession 
through the pages of the sea-novelists, losing, to be sure, 
something of their inexpressible garnishing as they enter 
the truer oceanic atmosphere of the Coopers and the 
Marryats of the present century. I refer simply to the old 
sailor, to the plain man-o'-war's man and merchantman of 
bygone years, not to the Frankenstein in flowing breeches 
and hat on nine hairs, who trod the stage and procured his 
circulation in one, two, and three volumes, in the respect- 
able name of Jack, prior even to the days when Sir Lancelot 
Greaves found the irresponsible anatomy willing to ship 

" ' The broad habergeon, 
Vant brace and greves and gauntlet.' 

Let me be understood. The British or American mariner 
of to-day is as hearty, nimble, dexterous, determined 
a fellow as ever he was at any time during the choicest 
and most glorious period of his nation's history. He 
needs but opportunity to test him. It is in his tradi- 
tions, habits, superstitions, that he differs from his pre- 
decessors. I do not think it is the iron of his latter-day 
calling that has entered his soul and changed him ; the 
very distinguishable difference is owing to a natural decay 
of marine sentiment. He is no longer superstitious 



352 Music OF THE WATERS. 

possibly because he is not without a tincture of education. 
Hard wear has attenuated his prejudices, and custom has 
lost its hold upon him. It would be difficult now, I should 
think, to find in any forecastle such a superstitious sea-dog 
as the old salt who, in Dana's ' Two Years before the 
Mast/ agreed with the black cook as to the malignant 
and wizard qualities of the Finns. Familiarity with the 
grand liquid amphitheatre into which he descends and toils 
for his bread may have helped to rob the modern sailor of 
what I must call the romantic features of the seaman's 
nature. In olden times the voyage was long, the art of 
navigation crude and halting, the wonders of the deep 
were many, at least, they were found so ; a man passed so 
long a while at sea that he was saturated with the spirit of 
it. Superstitions, salt as the billow from which they were 
wrought, begot peculiar forms of thought ; customs grew 
out of the strange fancies and interpretations, and that they 
should now be dead means simply that they flourished for 
centuries, and that they died very hard at last. How wide 
the difference is between the shipboard life of the mariners 
of the past and that of the present race of seamen may be 
collected by looking into a few of the customs which are 
now as extinct as the timbers of Noah's ark. In the seven- 
teenth and eighteenth centuries it was a practice on board 
Italian and Spanish, and possibly Portuguese ships, for 
the sailors, on crossing the equator, to erect a canopy on 
the forecastle, under which three seamen, absurdly dressed, 
seated themselves. One was called the president, the 
others judges. They started first with trying the captain, 
then the officers, and finally the passengers. A sailor, 
dressed up as a clerk, read the indictments, after which the 
judges pronounced sentence of death. Careri, in his 
' Voyage round the World,' explains the purpose of this 
tomfoolery. ' The sentence of death,' says he, 'was imme- 
diately bought off with money, chocolate, sugar, biscuit, 
flesh, sweetmeats, wine, and the like.' The best of it was 
that he who did not pay immediately, or give good security, 



Music OF THE WATEBS. 353 

was laid on with a rope's end, at the least sign given by 
the ' President Tarpaulin.' Apparently heavier punish- 
ments than rope's-ending attended the poverty or contumacy 
of the convicted, for the same author tells of a passenger 
who was drowned on board a galleon through being keel- 
hauled for refusing to conform to this singular marine 
custom. The sport if sport it can be called lasted all 
day, and then at sundown the fines or forfeits were divided 
among the sailors. It is possible that out of this old sea 
joke rose the stupid and irritating practice of ducking men 
on their crossing the equator for the first time. This 
imbecile piece of horse-play was wonderfully popular among 
seamen down to quite recent days. I do not think Jack 
ever saw much humour himself in the mere dressing-up as 
Neptune, and acting Jack Pudding in the waist ; what he 
relished was the privilege, by prescription, of lording it over 
the captain and officers for a few hours, and tarring and 
soaking people to whom, at other times, he would have to 
pull his forelock, with the whole length of the ship between 
him and their nobility. Another curious custom was to 
be found on board Dutch vessels. When a ship entered 
the 39th parallel, ' every one,' writes John Nieuhoff (1640), 
* of what quality or degree soever, that has not passed there 
before is obliged to be baptized or redeem himself from it. 
He that is to be baptized has a rope tied round his middle, 
wherewith he is drawn up to the very top of the bowsprit, 
and from thence three times successively tumbled into the 
water. A man was at liberty to get another to take his 
place by paying him.' Plenty of money and other good 
things must have been earned by the sailors out of this 
custom, for one may conceive that a nervous passenger 
would pay handsomely to escape so formidable a ducking 
as the tall bowsprits of those days promised, whilst, on the 
other hand, a seasoned manner would look upon such 
sousings as mere child's play think no more of it than a 
man in a regatta now thinks of walking out upon a greasy 
boom to loose the pig in the sack at the end of it. The 

A a 



354 Music OF THE WATERS. 



practice, however, eventually led to such riots, broils, and 
bloodshed, that it was forbidden by the Dutch Government. 
It was long preserved, however, in the British navy as a 
punishment. In the Annual Register for 1797, there is 
an account of four naval officers who were soused by a 
mutinous crew on board his Britannic Majesty's ship 
Sandwich. The writer calls it a 'curious ceremony.' 
The unhappy naval officers must have thought it so ! 

" * They tie the unfortunate victims' feet together, and 
their hands together, and put their bed at their back, 
making it fast round them, at the same time adding an 
eighteen-pound ball-shot to bring them down. They 
afterwards make them fast to a tackle suspended from the 
yardarm, and hoisting them nearly up to the block, all at 
once let go, and drop them souse into the sea, where they 
remain a minute, and then are again hoisted and let down 
alternately, till there are scarce any signs of life remaining.' 
When the miserable victims are ducked enough (according 
to the fancy of their judges), they are triced up by the 
heels that the water may run out of them, and then stowed 
away in their hammocks. This kindness was denied to the 
four naval officers, who, after having hung head down for 
some time, were tumbled into a boat and sent ashore." * 

The following extract is from "A Land-Lubber's Log/' 
in the Newcastle Weekly Chronicle : 

BURYING THE DEAD HORSE. 

Auctioneer. " A poor old man came riding by. 

Chorus. And they say so, and they hope so. 
A uctioneer. A poor old man came riding by. 
Chorus. A poor old man, 

A poor old man came riding by. 
Auctioneer. They say, old man, your horse will die. 
If he dies I will tan his hide, 
And if he lives I will ride him again ; 
I'll have his hide to make my shoes. 

1 Clarke Russell. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 355 

Auctioneer. We'll drag him along to his burial-place, 
O pull, my boys, and make a noise. 
You, poor old horse, what brought you here, 
After carrying turf for many a year 
From Bantry Bay to Ballyack, 
When you fell down and broke your back ? 
You died from blows and sore abuse, 
And were salted down for the sailor's use. 
The sailors they the meat despise, 
They turned you over and (ahem'd) your eyes, 
They ate the meat and picked the bones, 
And gave the rest to Davy Jones ; 
And if you don't believe it's true, 
Go look in the harness cask, and find his 
shoes." 

" The music to this extraordinary song," says the writer, 
" was strange and crude, but marked by a weird, mournful 
melody, recalling what one has read of the caoine that was 
formerly sung by the Irish over their dead. . . . Each line 
was sung twice over by the auctioneer, and the crew 
followed in chorus with the alternate refrain." The cere- 
mony of " Burying the Dead Horse " is now almost an 
obsolete one, and is rarely witnessed save on Australian- 
bound passenger-ships. As to its origin I cannot find any 
authentic information, the custom is certainly confined to 
the British mercantile service. " The Dead Horse " is 
typical of one month's pay advanced on shore, and which, 
after twenty-eight days, has been worked out. The horse's 
body is made out of a barrel, and his extremities of hay or 
straw, covered with canvas, the mane and tail of hemp, or 
still better, of manilla ; the eyes consist of two ginger-beer 
bottles, which are sometimes filled with phosphorus. 
When the horse is completed, he is lashed to a box, which 
is covered by a rug and then drawn along, in Egyptian 
fashion, on a grating. 

A very humorous description of this ceremony, and 



356 Music OF THE WATERS. 

another set of lines and music known as " The Dead 
Horse," I had sent me, in a copy of The Parramatta Sun 
(a serio-comic magazine, issued fortnightly, during the 
voyage of the ship Parramatta from London to Sydney, 
September 9th, 1879, to December 8th, 1879). 

BURYING THE DEAD HORSE. 

" On Thursday, October 2nd, lat. 7-32 N., long. 25-20 W., 
Mr. Richard Tangye, the well-known judge and buyer of 
blood stock, attended the Parramatta sale, and purchased 
the animal which was too celebrated to need mention by 
name. At about eight o'clock a vast multitude of those 
interested in the turf were assembled on the poop, anxiously 
waiting to catch a glimpse of the noble animal as he 
emerged from his stable in the fore part of the ship. His 
jockey having mounted him, proceeded to the main-deck 
amidst a crowd of the ship's crew, singing as they did a song 
which would have deterred anybody with less spirit than 
Mr. Tangye from bidding. It appeared that the horse was 
a victim to fate, and that his dirge was being sung : 

" Oh ! now poor horse your time is come, 
And we say so, for we know so. 
Oh ! many a race I know you've won : 
Poor old man. 

2. I have come a long, long way, 

And, &c. 

To be sold upon this day. 
Oh, poor old man. 

3. I have made Fordham's heart jump with joy, 

And, &c. 
For many a long time he tried a Derby to win, 

4. But I was the moke to carry him in. 
So I hope I shall fetch plenty of tin. 

5. Oh ! gentlemen, walk up and speculate; 
If I go cheap, my heart will break. 

6. So now, Mr. Auctioneer, you can begin. 

And, &c. 



Music OF THE WATERS. 357 

" Put up, therefore, he was before the poop, the auctioneer 
introducing him to the public by narrating his past and 
prosperous career, and quickly inducing them to make 
spirited bids. The bidding commenced at five shillings, 
and speedily ran up to six pounds ten shillings, each 
person being answerable for the amount of his or her bid. 
The horse and jockey being knocked down, the crew sang 
the following requiem, the melody being the same as that 
for the dirge : 

" Now, old horse, your time is come, 

And we say so, for we know so. 
Altho' many a race you have won. 

Oh, poor old man. 
2. You're going now to say good-bye, 

And, &c. 

Poor old horse you're going to die. 
Oh, &c. 

" The procession moving forward, the horse and jockey 
were attached to a rope and hauled up to the main-yardarm, 
and were then, amid plenty of blue fire (stay, the jockey, 
who happened to be alive, was spared) committed to the 
deep. The crew then sang : 

" Now he is dead and will die no more, 

And we say so, for we know so. 
It makes his ribs feel very sore, 

Oh, poor old man. 
He is gone and will go no more, 

And we say so, &c. 
So good-bye, old horse ! 

We.say good-bye ! "

" It is in the superstitions of the sea that we must search 
for the beginning and history of many of the customs 
which in modified forms lingered down to the period of a 
late generation of seafarers. They veined the life with 
elements both of humour and romance, and I do not 
scruple to say that much of the poetry of the profession of 
the sea has perished with the extinction of the simple 
forecastle credulities of other ages. In the beginning of 
European navigation, in the times of Diaz, Cabot, Colum- 
bus, De Gama, and earlier yet, the mariner was a Roman 
Catholic, devout, profoundly superstitious, perpetually 
invoking the protection of the Blessed Virgin and the 
saints of heaven, finding miracles in the common opera- 
tions of nature, peopling the deep with wondrous monsters, 
glorifying its blue breast with the gleam and colour of the 
enchanted island, gazing awe-struck about him as. he sailed 
along, and willing to believe anything he was told. I 
could give you no better illustration of this than the 
remark of the Jesuit, Anthony Sepp, in his account of a 
voyage from Spain to Paraguana : ' Towards the evening,' 
says he, ' we saw an entire rainbow quite across the sky, 
resembling our rainbows.' Resembling our rainbows ! As 
though the worthy father supposed that rainbows in those 
unfamiliar seas were very different from the same radiant 
arches which span the showers of Italy, Spain, and 
Germany. They were prepared for all sorts of wonders, 
and their imaginations created what their eyes could not 
see. The lightning was not that of Europe ; the thunder 
was the reverberation of some hellish conflicts between 
armies formed of fiends of satanic stature ; the very rain 



'Music OF THE WATEES. 359 



was unnatural, being coloured. Religion, or superstition if 
you will, interposed to mitigate the horrors of a perfervid 
fancy, wrought familiar appearances into celestial expres- 
sions, and instructed poor Jack to calm his perturbed soul, 
to quell the tempest, to exorcise the mermaid, to smooth 
the waters, to disperse the horrid shadows of the electric 
storm with litanies, effigies of saints, and spells of many 
different sorts. Thus Pirard de Laval (in ' Churchill's 
Collection of Voyages,' vol. i., p. 702) says, * We frequently 
saw great whirlwinds rising at a distance, called by the 
seamen dragons, which shatter and overturn any ship that 
falls in their way. When these appear, the sailors have a 
superstitious custom of repairing to the prow, or the side 
that lies next the storm, and beating naked swords against 
one another crosswise.' This custom long prevailed, 
scores of similar practices may be traced to the primitive 
superstitions of sailors. They unquestionably colour the 
old marine life, and their extinction leaves the calling un- 
comfortably bald, I think. The stars in those aged stories 
seem to glow the richer for the incense floating up to them 
from the little altar on the forecastle, and for the tender 
strains of a hundred voices rising in some solemn melo- 
dious canticle : 

(% ' The night is calm and cloudless, 

And still as still can be, 
And the stars come forth to listen 

To the music of the sea. 
They gather, and gather, and gather, 

Until they crowd the sky, 
And listen in breathless silence 

To the solemn litany. 
It begins in rocky caverns 

As a voice that chants alone 
To the pedals of the organ 

In monotonous undertone ; 
And anon from shelving beaches 

And shallow ?ands beyond, 



360 Music OF THE WATEES. 

In snow-white robes uprising 

The ghostly choirs respond. 
And sadly and unceasing 

The mournful voice sings on, 
And the snow-white choirs still answer, 

" Christe eleison ! " ' 

'The Golden Legend/ Longfellow. 

" The glory of the setting sun makes cloth of gold of the 
sails of those castellated fabrics, and they look to float 
over fairy seas of purple as we view them through that 
atmosphere of superstition, in the midst of which those 
young and awe-struck imaginations made their miracu- 
lous voyages to the Indies and to the mighty shores of 
Columbia." Clarke Russell. 

The legends of the water, whether of ocean, river, or 
lake, are so numerous that one might go on alluding to 
them for pages and never exhaust the subject. There is 
ample material for a volume in the weird tales of voices 
and bells sounding under the sea; but I think I have said 
enough to show that, apart from the sailors' songs and 
boatmen's chants that echo from end to end of the world 
of waters, there is an eternal strain of music which, day 
and night, and summer and winter, rises from the sea, and 
may fitly be termed " The Music of the Waters." 

" Oh, strangely glorious and beautiful sea ! 
Sounding for ever mysteriously, 
Why are thy billows still rolling on 
With their wild and sad and musical tone ? 
Why is there never repose for thee ? 
Why slumberest thou not, oh, mighty sea ? " 



FINIS.
