## AUTHOR'S PREFACE

It is always a pleasant duty to acknowledge kindness and courtesy, but not always an easy one — in my case it would be almost impossible to do so by any other means than that afforded me here — for the world is wide, in spite of the daily assertions to the contrary; and the world of waters is wider. There is scarcely a port, and never one of any consequence, that I have not to thank for some part of my collection; and if the Consuls in those ports will accept them, I beg to tender my most cordial thanks to them for all the kindness and cordiality my applications have met with. My gratitude is also due to the Foreign Consuls in Great Britain, more especially to those in Newcastle-upon-Tyne; to the many authors and editors of periodicals, from whose books and articles I have quoted; to the numerous friends I know and do not know, who have done so much towards helping me in my work; to the editor of *The Shipping World* (Major E. R. Jones, United States' Consul, Cardiff), who originated the idea of a collection of the sailors' songs of all nations, by commissioning me to write for his paper a series of articles containing specimens of each country's "chanties;" and last, but not least, to the sailors themselves, without whose unwearying patience in singing for me their favourite "chanties," and in supplying me with all necessary information as to their use, &c., I should not have had the honour of inscribing to His Royal Highness Prince George of Wales, and to all who are interested in the sea and its toilers, "The Music of the Waters."

## INTRODUCTORY NOTE

Fresh as the breezes of that ocean to which they owe their inspiration, the "chanties" and songs here collected come to us as a most interesting and unique contribution to our literature of the sea. For this volume contains no mere study-compilation of more or less authentic sea-ditties, mingled with the nautical effusions of landsmen. It is original in its conception and execution. With one or two trifling exceptions, it is a collection of what may be styled "the genuine article" — not the creation of landsmen written for or about sailors, but the actual "working songs" of the sea that are in use at the present time.

Still further, this book contains not merely the ditties of our own Jack Tars, but a selection of the sea-songs of nearly all maritime nations, translated and ably commented on, from a literary, musical, and nautical point of view, together with a good deal of interesting information regarding them.

Whoever will drink of an unadulterated stream must go to the fountain-head. This, Miss Laura Alexandrine Smith has done, and that she has drunk deeply, is easy to be seen from the spirit and enthusiasm with which she writes. Possessing literary power of a high order and thorough musical knowledge, besides originality and perseverance, Miss Smith was well qualified for the performance of her task, and being a daughter of Mr. C. S. Smith, Russian Vice-Consul at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, she has had exceptionally good opportunities of obtaining the assistance of the Consuls of many ports.

With the courage of an original investigator, our authoress has ventured to "beard the lion in his den." She has personally gone straight to the "fo'c'sle," and interviewed the sailors not only of her own, but of other lands, and thus has gathered from the men's own lips, and from their manly voices, the words and melodies which are most popular among them. At the same time she has learned to understand and appreciate the force and meaning of that music which enables Jack to accomplish "a long pull, and a strong pull, and a pull all together."

Of course, in language and sentiment, some of these ditties are not all that could be desired, but the work being a collection of curious and genuine sea-songs as they exist — not as they should be — the task of selection and translation must have been one of considerable difficulty, and seems to have been ably and judiciously accomplished.

Doubtless to some minds a good deal of the versification may appear absurd, but it must be borne in mind that, in lyrical poetry, a strict regard for sense is not of so much importance as the rhythmical flow of united words and melody — especially in songs of the sea, where the union of syllables with sounds must be well suited to the "work" which they are meant to enliven and facilitate. Besides, is not the odd jumble of ideas and phrases, pathetic and ludicrous, presented in some of the chanties, in keeping with the well-known rough-and-tumble character of the men who sing them?

When merely read, these chanties cannot be fully or fairly appreciated, but when wedded to their appropriate "Music of the Waters," they will doubtless convey to the soul of the landsman somewhat of that interest and satisfaction which they have long afforded to the "toilers of the deep" all round the world.

To those who have wandered much over our little globe — especially to those who have done so in ships and seen something of the wonderful works of God in the deep, and become familiar with the hopes, joys, sorrows, sins, and sufferings of the sailor in his selected home — these "chanties" will assuredly bring back, like a half-forgotten yet never-to-be-forgotten dream, many a pleasant memory of tramping round the capstan, and heaving at the windlass, and yarns told in low tones when sails were flapping idly, and the starry host was mirrored grandly in the sleeping sea. No puny invention of man — steam or electric — will ever take the romance out of the sea! Everything here is relative. Man may modify his conditions. Some old things may pass away and some things may become new; but, as the great vault of heaven and the mighty ocean will remain unchanged and unchangeable from age to age, so will the music of the waters, not less than the music of the land, continue to well up in human souls, to gladden, strengthen and revive them, until that time comes when all music shall flow into one grand harmony of praise to our God and to the Lamb.

## INTRODUCTION

> "To-day a rude brief recitative,
> Of ships sailing the seas, each with its special flag or ship-signal,
> Of unnamed heroes in the ships of waves spreading and spreading far as the eye can reach,
> Of dashing spray, and the winds piping and blowing,
> And out of these a chant for the sailors of all nations,
> Fitful, like a surge." — Walt Whitman.

> "May not the agreeable impression produced by the rhythmical flow of the waves, and the soothing murmur of running water, have led various nations, independently of each other, to the wide-spread conception that they obtained their favourite instrument of music originally from the water? Or is this notion traceable to a common source, dating from a prehistoric age; perhaps from the early period when the Aryan race is surmised to have diffused its lore through various countries? Or did it originate in the old belief of the world with all its charms and delights having arisen from a chaos in which water constituted the predominant element?" — Engel's *Musical Myths and Facts*.

In these days, when, like everything else, shipping has made such rapid strides that journeys which formerly were looked upon with awe, and undertaken only in extreme necessity, are now made with positive indifference, we are too apt to look upon the sea as a liquid railway; to think that, with the piracy and the lubberly vessels that sailed the main in the olden days, the romance of ocean has passed away, and with the fleet Atlantic "greyhounds" fades the last glamour of mystery from the pages of marine history. But the romance of the sea can never die, and for all time we shall have the storms and calms that alternately rule the watery way, the wrecks and losses, the longings, the waitings, and the terrible tales, to remind us of man's inability to cope with the mysterious, trackless deep.

There is one being though who is never familiar with the sea, and that is the being who knows it best, namely, the sailor. In all he says or sings of the world of water that is his home, Jack is never guilty of any sentiment that breathes of mastery over the element, or exults in the life of the sea; it is too real a thing for him to adopt the conscious boastful, masterful tone which is attributed to him, and it is only sometimes in the impotence of despair that fierce imprecations on sea or wind will break from him. It is Gibbon who says, "There is but a plank between a sailor and eternity."

The poetry of the sea is written on shore. Sailors act it, but do not write it. They form part of the poetry of ocean; they are the heroes that shine from its living, terrible pages; they are, they must be, brave men who can do their duty 'midst such perils. They must be brave, or nature brands them cowards, for the wind and the wave are infallible tests of all a sailor's knots and splices. Neptune is an unrelenting judge, and hurries his prisoner, without trial or jury, into the Everlasting Presence.

Three great pleasures, in the midst of all his perils and privations, we may rest assured Jack enjoys: smoking, yarning, and singing. With a pipe, whensoever and wheresoever he can manage to hold it between his lips, a fairly appreciative audience round the galley fire or at the fo'c'sle head, and a song to enliven his labour when on the briny ocean, our blue-jacket is tolerably happy, and it is of this latter I am purposing to make a short study — for that sailors' songs are worth studying I am convinced, and from various points of view too. Musically they are most valuable, as showing how much they are characteristic of their subject, vocationally, as proving the amount of impetus or encouragement needed by the singer in his work, and poetically, by making known the feelings which animate a sailor's breast with regard to his home, his wife, his captain, and indeed all that concerns him, often as an exponent of Jack's intense admiration for the noble and heroic acts of others. With regard to smoking, there is a curious story told of an old salt who when in port was very fond of a churchwarden. On being asked if he always smoked a long pipe? he replied, "No; in harbours and in fine weather I smoke a long pipe; in fresh weather I smoke a cutty, and when it blows a gale of wind I chew."

Not Dibdin's, not Barry Cornwall's, not Campbell's, not any of the Pirates' Serenades, or "I'm Afloat"s, which may be seen in music-shop windows, illustrated by lithographic vignettes of impossible ships in impracticable positions, and may be heard sung in comfortable drawing-rooms to the tinkling of pianos by romantic young ladies, or in still waters in sight of green fields by landsmen yachting — not any of these are the songs that come under the heading of "Chanties, or Working Songs of the Sea." The songs of the sailor are sung to the accompaniment of the thrilling shrouds, the booming double bass of the hollow topsails, and the multitudinous chorus of ocean.

As the ship is originally wrought from the live oak-forests of Florida, and the pine mountains of Norway, the iron-mines of England, the hemp and flax fields of Russia, so the songs current upon her decks are the composite gifts of all sea-loving peoples. In almost all nations we find that each individual trade and occupation has its own particular songs, differing many times even in provinces of the same country, so, naturally, maritime countries have many kinds of sailors' songs, each port often being responsible for some particular chanty. Many of these seem lacking in meaning, but to us of the shore only. Depend upon it something commends them to the tar's notice. They must contain good mouth-filling words, with the vowels in the right place, and the rhythmic ictus at proper distance for chest and hand to keep true time; and at any rate these sea-songs are redolent of the freshness of the sea-breeze.

Talking of the dangers which menace our sailors reminds me of a story I heard à propos of this. A clergyman much interested in the blue-jackets was one day talking to one whom he wished to bring round to his way of thinking.

"How long have you been at sea?" he began.

"Twenty years," was the reply.

"Was your father a sailor?"

"Yes. He was drowned at sea."

"And your grandfather?"

"He was also lost at sea."

"But this is an awful prospect for you, my poor man. Are you not afraid to go to sea?"

Jack screwed up his eye, and put a fresh quid into his mouth preparatory to answering.

"Quits, parson; where did your father die?"

"In bed, of course, like a good Christian."

"And your grandfather?"

"He died in his bed too."

"That's bad, parson," says Jack, "are you not afraid to go to bed?"

The foregoing may be taken as a sample of a sailor's feelings when interviewed on the subject of his perilous life. The danger is there, and he is fully alive to it, and, as I have said before, is never familiar when speaking of the sea. But in any encounter like that just referred to, in which the slightest shade of doubt as to Jack's daring to trust himself on it, is mooted: the one who hazards the doubt is almost certain to get the worst of it.

I am quite aware that if I allude to the bad accommodation and scanty and coarse fare, as the portion of our sailors, I tread on dangerous ground. Our times are supposed to be changed times, and changed for the better too, for the blue-jackets; I trust it may be so. In speaking of Jack's lot, I do so comparatively, not from any wish to enter into so vexed a question as our sailor's condition has now become. With regard to the improvidence that is so characteristic of seafaring men, I cannot help thinking that, however much it is to be condoned on the score of their peculiar life, it is as much to be deplored for the lack of energy that fails to perceive and seize upon the means of remedy which are so palpably at hand, namely, the establishment of a compulsory seamen's fund. Other trades and occupations make provision for their members when age shall have robbed them of their power of labour, or illness have laid them temporarily aside; but for the sailors there is no such provision.

The evil arising from the want of it is very apparent; the remedy seems to lie with themselves. In the *Shipping World* of July, 1887, there appeared a paragraph stating that Mr. Thomas H. Ismay, head of the White Star Line, had suggested to the Mayor of Liverpool the foundation of a Seamen's Pension Fund, and promised to give it a start with the princely donation of £20,000. The object of the fund would be to provide pensions for British sailors who have sailed out of Liverpool, or in Liverpool-owned ships, and who have been unable to make adequate provision for their declining years. The pension would be fixed at £20 a year, and on no account would be given to other than a British sailor, and no seaman to be eligible for a pension who had not attained the age of fifty years, and could prove twenty-five years' service at sea, either as captain, deck officer, or seaman. The fund, Mr. Ismay suggests, might be invested in the name of the Mercantile Marine Service Association, who will have the power of selecting suitable candidates for the pension. No great home to be erected, the whole of the fund to be applied to the object in view.

One can scarcely wonder at the style or sentiment of these Sailor Chanties, seeing that they are really, in many cases, the true expression of the feelings of the men who originate them — the strangest men perhaps, taking them all in all, one can meet with; though, certainly, I think Jack is somewhat less black than he is painted. As Lord Brassey in his work on "British Seamen" says: "Sailors spend their life for the most part far removed from the best influences which can elevate human nature, far from their native land, far from their hearths and homes, on the broad and lonely sea, where the authority of the magistrate cannot reach, where public opinion is unfelt, and the Sabbath bell is unheard." He is hardly to be judged by the same standard as a landsman, his life is so different. So much rougher discipline, so much more severe, that no wonder during their sometimes short holidays our tars squander their substance in the riotous manner that has become proverbial of them. Think how many months they spend in exile, enduring many serious hardships, beside which the trials of shore-men seem insignificant; scanty rations, often of the most revolting description, always of the coarsest; hard, rough work in the most terrible degrees of heat and cold, wretched accommodation, and at all times the presence of imminent peril, which, although naturally the case in all lives, always seems to me to be more terribly near at sea. And we must confess a sailor's life has much to make it undesirable, and yet, for all that, taking them as a class, they are healthy, hearty fellows, and well deserving of the epithet of "Jolly Tars."

Knowing what an impressionable set of men sailors as a rule are, we cannot wonder that anything which appeals so much to the emotional side of nature as music does, should play an important part in their daily round of work. What the "Ranz des Vaches" does for the Swiss herder when minding his flocks on the hills of his country, the "Marseillaise" for the eager Frenchman on his way to death or victory, the discordant sound of the bagpipes for the Highlander on a foreign battle-field, that does the chanty for the blue-jacket. It is not recreation, it is an essential part of the work on ship-board, it mastheads the topsail yards when making sail, it starts and weighs the anchor, it brings down the main-tack with a will, it loads and unloads the cargo, it keeps the pumps a-going; in fact, it does all the work where unison and strength are required. I have heard many an old salt say that a good chanty was worth an extra hand.

In his admirably nautical novel, "Two Years before the Mast, or a Sailor's Life at Sea," Mr. Dana says of the chanties: "The sailors' songs for capstans and falls are of a peculiar kind, having a chorus at the end of each line. The burden is usually sung by one alone, and at the chorus all hands join in, and the louder the noise the better. A song is as necessary to sailors as the drum and fife to a soldier. They cannot pull in time, or pull with a will, without it. Many a time when a thing goes heavy with one fellow yo-ho-ing, a lively song, like 'Heave to the Girls,' 'Nancy oh!' 'Jack Crosstree,' &c., has put life and strength into every arm. We often found a great difference in the effect of the different songs in driving in the hides. Two or three songs would be tried, one after the other, with no effect; not an inch could be got upon the tackles. When a new song struck up it seemed to hit the humour of the moment, and drove the tackles to blocks at once. 'Heave round hearty,' 'Captain gone Ashore,' and the like, might do for common pulls; but on an emergency, when we wanted a heavy, raise-the-dead pull, which should start the beams of the ship, there was nothing like 'Time for us to go,' 'Round the Corner,' or 'Hurrah! hurrah! my hearty Bullies.' 'Cheerily, Men,' when we came to masthead the topsail-yard with all hands at the halyards, might have been heard miles away."

Speaking again of the advantages of music at sea, the same author says: "We pulled the long distances to and from the shore with our loaded boats without a word spoken, and with discontented looks, while they not only lightened the labour of rowing, but actually made it pleasant and cheerful by their music; so true is it that

> 'For the tired slave, song lifts the languid oar,
> And bids it aptly fall with chime
> That beautifies the fairest shore,
> And mitigates the harshest crime.'"

He is alluding to the Americans in San Pedro.

Besides the working songs, there are others for the forecastle and dog-watches; for a sailor, in his moments of leisure, will as soon listen to a ballad as a yarn, and an audience round the galley fire, or at the fo'c'sle-head, requires what the hearers of our old ballads demanded, plenty of stirring incident and strong true feeling simply expressed. Our blue-jackets ought to be familiar with the tales of our grand old admirals and their victories, and should have songs in use amongst them as a stimulus to energy and courage that will make Blake, Vernon, and Anson more than mere names to them; those who man our ironclads should be full of that old spirit which defeated the Armada and won Trafalgar. There is no doubt that the inimitable sea-songs of Dibdin have done much to keep up the *esprit de corps* of our British sailors; they are, in fact, an inheritance which the nation will never, it is to be hoped, undervalue.

Whatever form naval warfare may hereafter assume, however the technicalities of the maritime profession may be altered, the spirit of the British seaman will be unchanged, he will be the same hearty, fearless, generous and simple being that Dibdin describes him, loving his country and his flag, reverencing his ship whether propelled by wind or steam, and adoring his Kate or Nancy.

Not only are Dibdin's songs popular with seamen, but they have obtained a deep hold on the national heart. There are few, I think, who are not familiar with some at least of them, fewer who have not heard and admired the pathos of "Tom Bowling," perhaps the most perfect of the many hundred songs left us by this great master of the art of writing of the sea. "Poor Jack," and "'Twas in the good Ship," are also great forecastle favourites, mixed up as they are with frequent quaint technical phrases and expressions, rendering them perfectly characteristic and inimitable, and expressing such thoroughly wise, brave, and gentle sentiments.

But the songs that Jack loves best, the songs that are sung with a will, whether by old or young, are the ones that have for theme "His Nancy," and, whether sailing away with the fresh memory of her last good-bye ringing in his ears, or homeward-bound with the eager thought of the welcome that will be his, she is never far from his thoughts. The sailors' favourite expression, rude though the poetry of it may be, always seems to me to be thoroughly characteristic of their thoughts, viz. that "the girls have hold of the tow-rope and can't haul the slack in fast enough."

There is yet another class of songs that would come under the heading of "Music of the Waters," though they are half of the shore. I mean those which the coasters croon in their lonely watches, those the fishermen sing when mending their nets; for, though certainly this is properly speaking land work, still the sea is all about them, the very air is laden with its fresh briny smell, the sounds in their ears are the sounds the waves make as they break on the shore, their thoughts are probably far away from the comfortable haven where they sit, so naturally their song follows their thoughts and becomes of the sea.

Rowing-songs should, I think, also be included in this class. They can scarcely be considered as working-songs, though I have no doubt the tune and swing of the music will have as much effect on the oarsmen as all rhythmical music has on work that requires to be done with strength and in unison. There is a certain charm about music on the water which that of the shore can never give, and probably we all have some pleasant souvenirs in our minds of golden August mornings on the sunny Thames, or soft moonlit nights on some placid lake, when the perfection of the already perfect situation was enhanced by some dreamy, soothing song that seemed to waft itself over the water and find its echo on the distant shore.

Doubtless more than half the romance we always associate with Venice is due (for those who have been there) to the memory of the gondolas that carried them through the many canals of the City of Doges, and the gondoliers who at one and the same time charmed their sense of seeing and hearing by the picturesqueness of their costume and the soft snatches of song they trolled out en route.

I think most people will be familiar with Moore's exquisite Canadian Boat Song, so suggestive of the motion of the dipping of the oars in the water that one can almost fancy one hears the splash, and sees the spray that rises, when it is sung.

As far as I have been able to learn, the songs of the sea take very much the same form and character in all nations, that is, they are sung on the same occasions, are much of the same type, namely, alternate soli and chorus, are at all times very erratic in metre and varied in theme, and almost always similar, and to be traced to the general music of the country to which they belong.

The first vocal performance recorded in the Bible is the song of Miriam the prophetess and her companions after the crossing of the Red Sea. Surely this song of praise, commemorative of perhaps the most wonderful event in all the history of the mighty deep, is worthy a place 'midst the music of the waters.

Mr. Engel, in his valuable book on "The Music of the most Ancient Nations," says, in speaking of this song of Miriam, "that it is in the form of alternate soli and chorus. A section, or perhaps a whole period, is sung by one alone, then repeated by a number of singers, either in unison or harmony, or, the chorus, instead of repeating the melody of the solo, takes it up and extends it; or else the solo singer is now and then interrupted by the chorus, which at intervals interposes a phrase."

Sacred history does not tell us what song rose to the lips of those fishermen of old when on the awful fury of the tempest that raged around them fell that calm, majestic command, which won such instant obedience, of "Peace, be still." We are familiar with the fearful question they asked of each other, "What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?"

## ENGLISH AND AMERICAN "CHANTIES;" OR, WORKING SONGS OF THE SEA

> "Sails of silk, and ropes of sendal,
> Such as gleam in ancient lore;
> And the singing of the sailors,
> And the answer from the shore."

Sailors' talk is a dialect as distinct from ordinary English as is Lowland Scotch. Certainly, English words are used, but their signification is many times remote from the meaning they have in shore parlance. The meaning of many sea-phrases is too subtle for translation; some fit vocational conditions so accurately, that any divergence from the exact expression would puzzle a seaman exceedingly. The idiosyncrasies of the forecastle are many, and one can readily sympathize with the feelings of the Judge who was so much puzzled by Jack's evidence, which Mr. Clark Russell speaks of in his humorous preface to his book on "Sailors' Language."

A man must go to sea to understand (as a sailor), the shades of signification in the terms; no books give them, they cannot be mastered by listening to seamen talking, and to seek for an explanation of any nautical phrase which strikes one as being peculiar, is only to let oneself deeper and deeper into the mire. Therefore, if the words Jack sets to his music seem wanting in meaning and lacking in sense, we must attribute it to the difference that exists between the seamen's mode of expressing themselves and ours. The sailor does not lack for singing; he sings at certain parts of his work — indeed he must sing if he would work.

On vessels of war, the drum, fife, or boatswain's whistle furnish the necessary movement regulator. There is a vast difference between the merchant sailor and his fellow "salt," the man-o'-war's man, whom they call "Johnny Haul-taut," or "John o' Fight." They hold each other in mutual derision, although without any unfriendly feeling. Accustomed to the comparative independence and free life of a merchant-vessel, they look with scorn on the binding discipline and severe penalties of a man-o'-war, and laugh contemptuously as they watch the crew in uniform dress walk round the windlass, and weigh anchor like mechanical dummies:

> "Your work is very hard, my boys,
> Upon the ocean sea,
> And for your reefing topsails,
> I'd rather you as me
> I feather my oar unto the shore,
> So happy as I be in the Guard-ship, ho!"

No hearty chanties there — no fine chorus ringing with feeling and sentiment, brought out with the sort of despairing wildness, which so often strikes neighbouring landsfolk with the deepest emotion. He likes to growl and he may, so long as he goes about his work. I have heard mates say, "Give me a man that can growl: the more he growls, the more he works." Silence reigns supreme aboard a Queen's ship; no general order is given by word of mouth, the boatswain's whistle takes its place. There, where the strength of one or two hundred men can be applied at one and the same effort, the labour is not intermittent, but continuous. The men form on either side of the rope to be hauled, and walk away with it like firemen marching with their engine; when the headmost pair bring up at the stern or bow, they part, and the two streams flow back to the starting-point outside the following files. Thus in this perpetual "follow my leader way" the work is done, with more precision and steadiness than in the merchant service. In it the heavier work is done by each man doing his utmost at the same moment. This is regulated by the "Chanty," and here is the true singing of the deep sea — it is not recreation, it is an essential part of the work. It will masthead the topsail-yards, on making sail; it will start the anchor, ride down the main-tack with a will, it will break out and take on board cargo, and keep the pumps going. A good voice and a stirring chorus are worth an extra man.

A writer in the *St. James's Gazette* of December 6th, 1884, says: "The beau-ideal chanty-man has been relegated to the past. His death-knell was the shriek of the steam-whistle, and the thump of the engines. When he flourished British ships were manned by British seamen, and carried much stronger crews in proportion to their tonnage than their successors. In those days gipsy-winches, patent windlasses and capstans, had no existence, and the heaving and hauling had to be performed by manual strength and labour; and to make the work 'go' lighter, the chanty-man chanted his strange lays, while the tars with hearty good-will joined in the refrains and choruses. Lieutenant Bassett, in his 'Legends and Superstitions of the Sea and of Sailors in all Lands and at all Times,' says: 'The old type of sailor, who believed in the mermaid, the sea-snake, and the phantom ship, is fast disappearing, and, with the gradual substitution of the steamship for the sailing-vessel, he is being replaced by the mechanical seaman, who sees no spectre in the fog, nor sign of disaster in the air or beneath the wave.'"

Old tars tell us that the chanties are not what they were before steam became so universal: one added, on telling me this, "I'll tell you what it is, Miss, steamboats have not only taken the wind out of our sails, but they have taken the puff out of us too, and them as remembers ship-life as it was, will scarcely recognize it now-a-days." This advocate of the old school was one of many "old salts" whose acquaintance I made, and who good-naturedly sang for me several of their best-remembered chanties in a Sailors' Home in the North of England.

There are several kinds of chanty, though I believe, properly speaking, they should only be divided into two classes, namely, those sung at the capstan and those sung when hauling on a rope: but there are, over and above these, pumping songs — pumping being part of the daily morning duty of a well-disciplined merchant-vessel, just a few minutes' spell to keep the vessel free and the cargo unharmed by bilge-water; it is not a dismal sound at all, rather a lively one. There are also chanties used when holy-stoning the decks, and when stowing away the cargo; and indeed I think one may safely conclude that every one of Jack's duties, from Monday morning to Saturday night, is done to some sort of music, and according to the Philadelphia catechism his labours do not end then, for in it we are taught that

> "Six days shalt thou labour and do all thou art able,
> And on the seventh, holy-stone the deck and clean-scrape the cable."

There is one job that sailors seldom fail to get, even when the weather is such as to prevent other work being done, and that is holy-stoning the decks. The men have to kneel down and push backwards and forwards a good-sized stone (usually sandstone), the planks being previously wetted and sprinkled with sand. From the fact of kneeling to it, this unpleasant task is known at sea under the title of "saying prayers."

In the capstan chanties the metre is generally long, and they are of a more pathetic nature than the hauling ones. To those who have heard it as the men run round the capstan, bringing up the anchor from the English mud of a ship outward bound for a two or three years' trip, perhaps never to return, what can be more sad or touching, although sung with a hearty good-will, than "Yo, heave ho!"

> "Yo, heave ho! Round the capstan go!
> Round, men, with a will! Tramp, and tramp it still!
> The anchor must be heaved, the anchor must be heaved.
> Yo, ho! Yo, ho! Yo, ho! Yo, ho!"

Or such words as:

> "To the Liverpool Docks we'll bid adieu;
> To Suke, and Sally, and Poll too;
> The anchor's weighed, the sails unfurled;
> We are bound to cross the watery world.
> Hurrah! we're outward bound!
> Hurrah! we're outward bound!"

Liverpool, as the sailing-point and homeward goal of so many vessels, naturally figures very prominently in the sailors' chanties, and the air of romance that attaches itself to California, the Brazils, and Mexico also seems to have a peculiar charm for Jack. He has another outward-bound song something to this effect:

> "Steer, boys, steer, for California, O!
> There's plenty of gold in the land, I'm told,
> On the banks of the Sacramento."

Another outward-bound chanty is "To Rio Grande we're bound away":

> Solo. "Were you ever in Rio Grande?
> Chorus. Away you Rio.
> Solo. O were you ever in Rio Grande?
> Chorus. I am bound to the Rio Grande.
> Away you Rio, away you Rio.
> Fare you well, my pretty young girl,
> I am bound to the Rio Grande."

*(Many verses follow in the original, with the solo and chorus pattern continuing.)*

American vessels, I think, may be charged with the following, which are all capstan chanties: "Oceanida," "Johnny's Gone," "The Black Ball Line," and "Slapandergosheka" — the last-named with the incomprehensible title is addressed "To all you ladies now on land," and commences:

> "Have you got, lady, a daughter so fair?
> Slapandergosheka,
> That is fit for a sailor that has crossed the Line?
> Slapandergosheka."

It is almost impossible to discover which are British and which American, amongst the chanties, they are so mixed up with each other, and any which may formerly have been characteristic of the one country, have become so cosmopolitan, that the sailors themselves have been unable to discriminate between them. I have, therefore, acting upon some very reliable advice, thought it better to classify under one heading all chanties with English words, although there are many cases where the nationality is beyond doubt. Coloured men being, as a rule, such good singers and ingenious poets, may be credited with many.

One of the best known of the capstan chanties is "Haul the bowline." When a ship is tacking, the tacks and sheets are let run in order that the yards may be swung round to meet the altered position of the ship. They must then be hauled taut again, and secured, in order to keep the sails in their place, and to prevent them from shaking when the ship's head comes up in the wind. If the crew are too few in number, or too slow at their work, and the sails get fairly filled on the new tack, it is a fatiguing piece of work enough to "board" the tacks and sheets; you pull at one end of the rope and the gale tugs at the other. The advantages of lungs are all against you, and perhaps the only thing to be done is to put the helm down a little, and set the sails shaking again before they can be trimmed properly. If the watch on deck has not been over spry, the consequence is that the big main is slatting and flying out overhead with a might that shakes the ship from stem to stern. The flapping of the mad canvas will be like a giant's fist thumping on a drum. The sheets will be jerking at the belaying-pins, the blocks rattling in sharp, castanet-like snappings. The sea is lashing and seething alongside in white particles of phosphorescent foam, whilst overhead all is black with the flying scud. All the most forcible expressions that can be thought of may be used without avail, the sail won't come. "Then give us the song, men," sings out the mate at last. "Pull with a will," "Together, men! Altogether, now!" And then a voice will strike up:

*[Here the original book contains the musical notation for "We'll haul the bowline."]*

At the last word every man will throw his whole strength into the pull, all singing it in chorus, quickly and explosively, and so jump by jump, the sheet will be hauled taut at last.

Another version of "Haulin' the Bowlin'":

> 1. Haul on the bowlin', the fore and main-top bowlin',
>    Haul on the bowlin', the bowlin', Haul.
> 2. Haul on the bowlin', the packet she's a rollin',
>    Haul on the bowlin', the bowlin', Haul.
> 3. Haul on the bowlin', the captain he's a growling
>    Haulin' the bowlin', the bowlin', Haul.

At the word Haul, which terminates each couplet, the tars give a tremendous jerk on the rope.

One of the wildest and most mournful of the sailor songs is "Lowlands." The chorus is even more than usually meaningless, but the song is the sighing of the wind and the throbbing of the restless ocean translated into melody:

> Solo. I dreamt a dream the other night:
> Chorus. Lowlands, Lowlands, Hurrah, my John!
> Solo. I dreamt I saw my own true love:
> Chorus. Lowlands a-ray!

Much care was evidently given to "Lowlands" by the chanty-men. It has often been improved. In its original form the first chorus was shorter and less striking, and the words of the second chorus were, "My dollar and a half a day."

> Solo. Lowlands, Lowlands, away, my John.
> Chorus. My dollar and a half a day.
> Solo. I took up my clothes and I went away.
> Chorus. Lowlands, Lowlands, a-ray.

Of the same general character as "Lowlands," though inferior to it, is the song usually known as "Across the Western Ocean."

Sometimes the anchor comes up to a fierce chorus compounded of improvised abuse of the ship and captain. "Old Stormy" is a mythical character often mentioned in sailors' songs. Who Stormy was, and why he received that evident nickname, even the most profound and learned chanty-men always confessed themselves unable to explain.

> Solo. Old Stormy he is dead and gone:
> Chorus. To me, way, hay, storm along, John!
> Solo. Old Stormy he is dead and gone:
> Chorus. Ah, ha! come along, get along, storm along, John.
> Solo. Old Stormy he was a bully old man:
> Chorus. Fi-i-i, massa, storm along.

This is a great favourite, and often sung after a gale of wind.

> Solo. Old Storm Along is dead and gone,
> Chorus. Ay! ay! ay! Mr. Storm Along!
> Solo. When Stormy died, I dug his grave,
> I dug his grave with a silver spade,
> I hove him up with an iron crane,
> And lowered him down with a golden chain
> Old Storm Along is dead and gone.
> Chorus. Ay! ay! ay! Mr. Storm Along.

*(Each line is repeated twice.)*

The solemnity of the air and the mock-seriousness of the words have a most comical effect, and reminded me very much, when I heard them sung, of the tale of "The Death of Cock Robin." I have since come across a somewhat different version of the words of this chanty, in which "Stormy" was written "Starmy," and of which the ending was:

> Solo. We carried him along to London town,
> Chorus. Starm Along, boys, Starm Along.
> Solo. We carried him away to Mobille Bay,
> Chorus. Starm Along, boys, Starm Along.

### HAULING CHANTIES

Of these, there is first the hand-over-hand song, in very quick time; then the long-pull song, when there are, perhaps, twenty or thirty men pulling on a rope. To be effective, the pull must be made unanimously. This is secured by the chanty, the pulling made at some particular word in the chorus. For example, in the following verse the word "handy" is the signal, at each repetition, for a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together:

> Chorus. Oh, shake her up, and away we'll go,
> So handy, my girls, so handy;
> Up aloft from down below,
> So handy, my girls, so handy.

One of the best and jolliest quick-time songs, and certainly one of the most well-known, is "Blow the Man Down":

> Solo. I'm a true English sailor, just come from Hong-Kong,
> Heigh, ho, blow the man down!
> My stay on the old English shore won't be long,
> Give me some time to blow the man down.
> Chorus. Then we'll blow the man up, and we'll blow the man down,
> Heigh, ho, blow the man down!
> So we'll blow the man up, and we'll blow the man down!
> Then give me some time to blow the man down.

> Solo. As I was a-walking down Winchester Street
> Heigh-ho, blow the man down;
> A pretty young girl I happened to meet,
> Oh, give me some time to blow the man down.

"Reuben Ranzo" is, perhaps, the greatest favourite with the men of all the chanties. The tune is mournful and almost haunting in its monotony:

> Solo. Pity Reuben Ranzo,
> Chorus. Ranzo, boys, a Ranzo.
> Solo. Oh, pity Reuben Ranzo,
> Chorus. Ranzo, boys, a Ranzo.
> Solo. Reuben was no sailor,
> Chorus. Ranzo, boys, a Ranzo.
> Solo. By trade he was a tailor,
> Chorus. Ranzo, &c.
> Solo. He went to school on Monday,
> Solo. Learnt to read on Tuesday,
> Solo. He learnt to write on Wednesday,
> He learnt to fight on Thursday,
> On Friday he beat the master,
> On Saturday we lost Reuben,
> And where do you think we found him?
> Why, down in yonder valley,
> Conversing with a sailor.
> He shipped on board of a whaler;
> He shipped as able seamen do;
> Oh, pity Reuben Ranzo.
> The captain was a bad man,
> He took him to the gangway,
> And gave him five-and-forty.
> The mate he was a good man,
> He taught him navigation;
> Now he's captain of a whaler,
> And married the captain's daughter,
> And now they both are happy.
> This ends my little ditty,
> Chorus. Ranzo, boys, a Ranzo!
> Belay there, lads, belay.

The chorus continues the same all through; the pull always being made at the word "Ranzo." Each line of the solo is also repeated.

Then there is the well-known topsail-halyard song, "Sally Racket," greatly used by the sailors when loading their ships with timber at Quebec:

> Solo. Sally Racket, hoy oh,
> Chorus. Cheerily, men.
> Solo. Sally Racket, hoy oh!
> Chorus. Cheerily, men.
> Solo. Pawned my jacket, hoy oh.
> Solo. Sold the ticket, hoy oh.
> Solo. That's not the worst, hoy oh.
> Solo. She left me in the lurch, hoy oh.
> Solo. I don't care a rap, hoy oh.
> Solo. If she never comes back, hoy oh,
> Solo. I can get another girl, hoy oh.
> Solo. Good-bye, Sally Racket, hoy oh.
> Solo. You can keep my old jacket, hoy oh.
> Solo. And burn the ticket, hoy oh.
> *(Spoken)* That'll do, boys.

I am told that the oldest chanty on record is one that goes by the name of "Cheerily, men; oh holly, hi-ho, cheerily, men." It is a typical specimen of an English sailor-song of a remote period, for undoubtedly many of the sailor-songs are of negro origin. They are the reminiscences of melodies sung by negroes stowing cotton in the holds of ships in Southern ports.

"Pay me the money down" is a very favourite pumping chorus:

> Solo. Your money, young man, is no object to me.
> Chorus. Pay me the money down.
> Solo. Half-a-crown's no great demand.
> Chorus. Pay me the money down.
> Solo & Chorus. Money down, money down;
> Pay me the money down.

There is a rollicking, lively chorus:

> Chorus. Highland day and off she goes,
> Off she goes with a flying foretopsail,
> Highland day and off she goes.

### THE LION MAN-O'-WAR

A very popular song at Portsmouth is "The Lion Man-o'-War":

> "Are you the Lion man-o'-war, as we suppose you be?"
> "We are the Lion man-o'-war, as you shall quickly see."
> "Then haul your colours from the mast, and come along with me,
> Or we'll sink the Lion man-o'-war at the bottom of the sea."

---

### HOME, DEARIE, HOME

Amongst the favourite chanties of North-country sailors is that most charming and pathetic of songs, "Home, Dearie, Home":

> Solo. Oh, Amble is a fine town, with ships in the bay,
> And I wish with my heart I was only there to-day;
> I wish with my heart I was far away from here,
> A-sitting in my parlour, and talking to my dear.
> 
> Chorus. And it's home, dearie, home! oh, it's home I want to be.
> My topsails are hoisted, and I must out to sea,
> For the oak, and the ash, and the bonny birchen tree,
> They're all a-growin' green in the North-countree;
> Oh, it's home, dearie, home! oh, it's home I want to be.
> 
> Solo. Oh, there's a wind that blows, and it's blowing from the West,
> And of all the winds that blow 'tis the one I like the best;
> For it blows at our backs, and it shakes the pennon free,
> And it soon will blow us home to the North-countree.
> 
> Solo. And if it be a lass, she shall wear a golden ring;
> And if it be a lad, he shall live to serve his king;
> With his buckles, and his boots, and his little jacket blue,
> He shall walk the quarter-deck, as his daddy used to do.

*(The song "Oh, Amble is a fine town," is only in part ancient. The first three stanzas were written by Mr. William Ernest Henley in 1878, as an addition to the final stanza and the refrain.)*

Another very favourite song with the Northern seamen is "The Spanish Canoe," somewhat in the same style as the capstan song of "Lowlands":

> "Oh, I've got a ship in the North Countree,
> She goes by the name of the Golden Vanitee;
> I fear she will be taken by the Spanish Canoe,
> And they'll sink her in the Lowlands low.
> Lowlands, Lowlands, they'll sink her in the Lowlands, low."

There is also a "Homeward Bound" song very well known to them:

> "At Catherine's Dock I bade adieu
> To Poll and Bet, and lovely Sue;
> The anchor's weighed, the sails unfurled,
> We're bound to plough the watery world;
> Don't you see we're outward bound.
>
> But when we come back to Catherine's Docks,
> The pretty girls they come in flocks;
> And Bet to Poll and Sue will say
> 'Oh, here comes Jack, with his three years' pay;'
> Don't you see we're homeward bound?
>
> Then we all set off to the 'Dog and Bell,'
> Where the best of liquor they always sell;
> In comes old Archy, with a smile,
> Saying 'Drink, my lads, it's worth your while;'
> Don't you see we're homeward bound?"

The chanty known by the name of "Whisky for my Johnny," or "Whisky Johnny," has many different verses:

> Solo. Oh whisky is the life of man;
> Chorus. Oh whisky! Oh Johnny!
> Oh whisky is the life of man!
> Chorus. Oh whisky for my Johnny!
> 
> Solo. Oh whisky makes me pawn my clothes,
> Oh whisky gave me a broken nose,
> I thought I heard the old man say,
> I thought I heard the old woman say,
> I thought I heard the steward shout,
> Chorus. Here's whisky for my johnny.
> 
> If I can't get whisky, I'll have rum,
> Chorus. Whisky, Johnny;
> Oh that's the stuff to make good fun,
> Chorus. Oh whisky for my Johnny.

BELAY THERE! — is generally said when the song comes to an end, or "Coil up the ropes there, boys."

### MARRIED TO A MERMAID

The following song was written down for me by a sailor. He told me that it was a favourite as a forecastle song, and was always received with enthusiasm at concerts on board ship. The chorus is set to "Rule Britannia":

> Solo. There was a rich young farmer,
> And he lived on Salisbury Plain,
> He loved a rich knight's daughter
> And she loved him again.
> But the knight he was distressed
> That they should sweethearts be,
> That they got the farmer pressed,
> And he sent him off to sea.
> Chorus. Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves,
> For Britons never, never, never shall be slaves.
> 
> Solo. Oh, 'twas on the deep Atlantic,
> During the equinoctial gales,
> That a young feller fell overboard,
> Among the sharks and whales.
> He fell right down so quickly,
> So headlong down fell he,
> That he tumbled out of sight, like a streak of light,
> To the bottom of the deep blue sea.
> 
> Solo. We lowered a boat to look after him,
> And we thought to find his corpse,
> When up to the top he came with a bang,
> And sung in a voice sepulchrally hoarse:
> "My comrades and my messmates all,
> Pray do not grieve for me,
> For I'm married to a mermaid
> At the bottom of the deep blue sea."
> 
> Solo. She raised herself on her beautiful tail,
> And gave him her wet white hand,
> Saying, "Long have I waited for you, my dear,
> You are welcome safe to land.
> Go back to your messmates for the last time,
> And tell them all from me,
> That you're married to a mermaid
> At the bottom of the deep blue sea."
> 
> Solo. And the anchor was raised and the sails unfurled,
> And the ship was running free,
> When up we went to our captain,
> And this we told to he.
> Now the captain he came to the old ship's side,
> And out loud bellowed he:
> "Be as happy as you can with your wife, my man,
> (There's no divorce court) At the bottom of the deep blue sea."

*(The words "there's no divorce court" are spoken.)*

### A YANKEE SHIP

> A Yankee ship came down the river,
> Blow, boys, blow.
> A Yankee ship came down the river,
> Blow, my bully boys, blow.
> And who do you think was skipper of her?
> Dandy Jim from old Carolina,
> Chorus. Blow, my bully boys, blow.
> And who do you think was second greaser?
> Why, Pompey Squash that big buck nigger,
> And what do you think they had for dinner?
> Monkey's lights and donkey's liver,
> And what do you think they had for supper?
> Hard tack and Yankee leather,
> Then blow, my boys, for better weather,
> Chorus. Blow, boys, blow.

This chanty is sometimes called "Blow, boys, blow."

### JOHN BROWN

> Solo. In eighteen hundred and sixty-one
> The Yankee war it was begun.
> Chorus. Glory, halleluiah! As we go marching along.
> 
> Solo. In eighteen hundred and sixty-two
> The niggers made a great ado.
> 
> Solo. In eighteen hundred and sixty-three
> The niggers they were all set free.
> 
> Solo. In eighteen hundred and sixty-four
> The Yankee war it was no more.
> 
> Solo. Old John Brown was the Abolition man.
> Solo. John Brown's knapsack was number 92.

"The exploits of the early American Navy," says *The New York Tribune*, "can be read on the cold pages of history, but nowhere do they live with such freshness and vigour as in the rude naval songs composed at the time when Paul Jones, Decatur, Hull and Pessy filled the annals of the sea 'with the splendid tumult of their deeds.' There is one old song called the 'Yankee Man-of-war,' descriptive of the cruise of John Paul Jones in the Irish Channel in 1778. The first and last stanzas are as follows:

> "'Tis of the gallant Yankee ship
> That flew the stripes and stars,
> And the whistling wind from the west-nor'-west
> Blew through the pitch-pine spars.
> With her starboard tacks about, my boys,
> She hung upon the gale;
> On an autumn night we raised the light
> Of the old Head of Kinsale.
>
> 'Out booms! out booms!' our skipper cried,
> 'Out booms, and give her sheet.'
> And the swiftest keel that ever was launched
> Shot ahead of the British fleet.
>
> And amid a thundering shower of shot,
> With stern-sails hoisted away,
> Down the North Channel Paul Jones did steal
> Just at the break of day."

In *One of Mr. Ballantyne's books, "The Red Eric, or the Whaler's Last Cruise,"* there is a song sung by one Gurney, when the men on board of this same whaler were grouped around the windlass. On receiving Gurney's promise to give them a song, his comrades ask "if there be any chorus to it?" "Ay, in course there is," is his reply. "Wot's a song without a chorus? Wot's plum duff without the plums? What's a ship without the helm? It's my opinion, shipmates, that a song without a chorus is no better than it should be. It's wus nor nothin'! It puts them wot listens in the blues, an' the man wot sings into the stews an' sarve him right. I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't give the fag end o' nothin mixed in a bucket o' salt water for a song without a chorus, that's flat; so here goes!"

> Solo. Oh, I once know'd a man as hadn't got a nose,
> An' this is how he came to hadn't:
> One cold winter night he went and got it froze;
> By the pain he was well nigh madden'd.
> Chorus. By the pain he was well nigh madden'd.
>
> Solo. Next day it swoll up as big as my head,
> An' tough as a junk of leather;
> (Ah! he yelled, so he did, fit to pierce ye through),
> An' then it fell off altogether!
> Chorus. Fell off altogether,
> An' then it fell off altogether.
>
> Solo. But the morial is wot you've now got to hear,
> An' it's good, as sure as a gun;
> An' you'll never forget it, my messmates dear,
> For this song it hain't got none.
> Chorus. Hain't got none;
> For this song it hain't got none.

Mr. Robert C. Leslie, in his "A Sea Painter's Log," says of sailors' songs: "Years ago, when the (little) Great Western was fighting an almost solitary battle of steam versus sail power upon the Atlantic, the old Black X sailing liners were notable for their musical crews; and capstan songs, as they were called, always came rolling aft from a liner's forecastle, as the men tramped round winding in the warp that was slowly moving her out of dock. I recollect the airs of many of these songs; but the words, except the choruses, were hard to catch, and some of these were coarse, or not worth much when caught. The following was written down as a very superior piece of poetry, and it was sung by a fellow of most 'comly making':

> Solo. Late one evening as I vas a valking.
> Chorus. Oh, ho, yes oho.
> Solo. O there I heard a loving couple talking;
> Chorus. A hundred years ago.
> Solo. It was a serious good old woman,
> And she vas a saying of things not common,
> She vas a saying unto her darter,
> O mind, then, vords o' mine herearter;
> Red-nosed men frequent the ale-'ouse,
> Sandy-'aired men are always jailous;
> The fat will coax, the lean will flatter,
> Oh, marry none of them, my darter:
> But marry a man of a 'comly making,
> For in him there's no mistaking:
> In so doing of w'ich you'll please me,
> And so of my troubles ease me."

In a tale entitled "The Man-o'-War's Man," there are some excellent choruses:

> Chorus. "O, Greenland is a cold countrie,
> And seldom is seen the sun;
> The keen frost and snow continually blow,
> And the daylight never is done,
> Brave boys,
> And the daylight never is done."
>
> Chorus. "Nor never will I married be
> Until the day I die;
> For the stormy winds and the raging sea
> Parted my love and I."
>
> Chorus. "O, the rose it is red and the violet is blue,
> And my heart, love, beats steady and constant to you,
> Then let it be early, late, or soon,
> I will enjoy my rose in June."
>
> Chorus. "Farewell and adieu to you, grand Spanish ladies,
> Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain,
> For we've received orders to sail for old England,
> But we hope in short time for to see you again."
>
> Chorus. "Then we'll drink and be jolly, and drown melancholy,
> Our spirits to cherish, our hopes and our lives,
> And we'll pay all our debts with a flying topsail;
> And so bid adieu to our sweethearts and wives."
>
> Chorus. "On the glorious, the second of April, all at the dawn of the day,
> We unreefed our topsails, and then we wore away;
> Lord Nelson on the poop did stand,
> With his spy-glass all in his hand,
> And all he said, as we pushed for the land,
> Was, 'Steady, and cheer up, ho.'"

### GOOD-BYE, FARE YE WELL

*(A capstan song)*

> Solo. It's of a flash packet, a packet I've seen;
> Chorus. Good-bye, fare ye well! Good-bye, fare ye well!
> Solo. She's a hearty flash packet, the Dreadnought's her name;
> Chorus. Hurrah, my boys! we're bound to go!
>
> Solo. She sails to the westward, where stormy winds blow,
> Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the westward we'll go.
> It's now we are hauling right out of the dock,
> Where the boys and the girls on the pier-head do flock.
> They give three loud cheers, while the tears downward flow,
> Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the westward we'll go.
> It's now we've arrived on the banks of Newfoundland,
> Where the water is green and the bottom is sand.
> Where the fish of the ocean swim round to and fro,
> Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the westward we'll go.
> Now we are running down Long Island shore,
> Where the pilot does "board" us, as he's oft done before.
> It's now we've arrived at New York once more,
> Where I'll see my dear Polly, the girl I adore.
> I'll call for strong liquors, and merry will be,
> Here's a health to the Dreadnought, where'er she may be.
> Here's a health to the captain and all his brave crew,
> Here's a health to the Dreadnought and officers too.
> And this song was composed when the watch went below,
> Bound away in the Dreadnought, to the westward we'll go.

A collection of English sailors' songs could scarcely be complete without some reference to those which are to be found in Shakespeare's *The Tempest*. Dr. Johnson says of the first scene in the first act that "This naval dialogue is perhaps the earliest example of sailors' language exhibited on the stage." The second Lord Mulgrave declared that Shakespeare's technical knowledge of seamanship must have been "the result of the most accurate personal observation."

Ariel's beautiful song, "Full Fathom Five," which Ferdinand describes so graphically — "This music crept by me upon the waters; allaying both their fury, and my passion, with its sweet air" — is too well known for me to do more than allude to it:

> "Full fathom five thy father lies;
> Of his bones are coral made;
> Those are pearls that were his eyes.
> Nothing of him that doth fade
> But doth suffer a sea-change
> Into something rich and strange.
> Chorus. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell;
> Hark! now I hear them ding-dong, bell."

Then there is Stephano's half-drunken:

> "I shall no more to sea, to sea;
> Here shall I die ashore.
> The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
> The gunner and his mate
> Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
> But none of us cared for Kate;
> For she had a tongue with a tang,
> Would cry to a sailor 'go hang!'
> Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!"

Towards the close of Queen Elizabeth's reign there was a grand outburst of sea songs. Captain Oxenham's "Westward Ho! with a rum-below":

> "For O, 'tis the herrings and the good brown beef,
> And the cider and the cream so white;
> O, they are the making of the jolly Devon Lads,
> For to play, and eke to fight.
>
> O, who will join jolly mariners all?
> And who will join, says he O!
> To fill his pockets with the good red gold,
> By sailing on the sea O!
>
> Our bodies in the sea so deep,
> Our souls in heaven to rest;
> Where valiant seamen one and all
> Hereafter shall be blest.
>
> O randy, dandy, dandy O,
> A whet of ale and brandy O!
> With a rumbelow and a 'westward ho!'
> And heave my mariners all O!"

Then there is also Father Neptune's famous song:

> "See every man the Pelican,
> Which round the world did go,
> While her stern-post was uppermost
> And topmasts down below.
> And by the way they lost a day,
> Out of her log was stole;
> But Neptune kind, with favouring wind,
> Hath brought her safe and whole.
>
> I am King Neptune bold,
> The ruler of the seas;
> I don't understand much singing upon land,
> But I hope what I say will please."

As might be expected, there is frequent mention of the Spaniards in these old Cornish and Devonian songs:

> "Oh, where be these gay Spaniards,
> Which make so great a boast O?
> Oh, they shall eat the grey goose feather,
> And we shall eat the roast O!"

Many of these rattling old sea-songs are sung, and well-known too, in Devonshire to this day; there is one, "The Mermaid," with a splendid chorus: "While we jolly sailor-boys were up aloft, And the land-lubbers lying down below, below, below."

### CAWSAND BAY

*(Still sung when ships of war are on distant stations.)*

> "In Cawsand Bay lying, with Blue Peter flying,
> And all hands turned up for the anchor to weigh,
> There came a young lady as fresh as a May-day,
> And, modestly hailing, this damsel did say,
>
> 'I wants a young man there, do you hear? Bear a hand there,
> To hoist me aboard, or to send him to me;
> For his name's Henry Grady, and I am a lady
> Just come to prevent him from going to sea.'
>
> Then the captain, his honour, when he looked upon her,
> Ran down the ship's side for to help her aboard.
> Says he, with emotion, 'What son of the ocean
> Can thus be looked after by Elinor Ford?'
>
> Then the lady made answer, 'That there is my man, sir,
> I'll make him as fine and as free as a lord.'
> 'No, no,' says the cap'n 'that cannot well happen;
> I've got sailing orders, you, sir, stay aboard!'
>
> 'Avast!' says the lady. 'Don't hear him, Henry Grady,
> He once was your captain, but now he's at large,
> Don't you stay aboard here, for all that man's order;'
> And out of her bosom she hauled his discharge."

### FAREWELL TO YOU, YE FINE SPANISH LADIES

*(Mr. Chappell gives the tune and six verses of this old sea-song.)*

> "Now farewell to you, ye fine Spanish ladies,
> Now farewell to you, ye ladies of Spain,
> For we've received orders to sail for old England,
> And perhaps we may never more see you again.
>
> We'll range and we'll rove like true British sailors;
> We'll range and we'll rove all on the salt seas;
> Until we strike soundings in the Channel of England,
> From Ushant to Scilly is thirty-five leagues.
>
> We hove our ship to, with the wind at sou'west, boys,
> We hove our ship to, for to strike soundings clear,
> Then filled the main top-sail, and bore right away, boys,
> And straight up the Channel our course we did steer.
>
> The first land we made, it is called the Dead-man,
> Next, Ram Head off Plymouth, Start, Portland, and Wight.
> We sailed by Beachy, by Fairly, and Dungeness,
> And then bore away for the South Foreland Light.
>
> Then the signal was made for the grand fleet to anchor,
> All in the downs that night for to sleep;
> Now stand by your stoppers, see clear your shank painters,
> Haul up your clew garnets, stick out tacks and sheets.
>
> Now let ev'ry man toss off a full bumper,
> Now let ev'ry man take off his full bowl,
> For we will be jolly, and drown melancholy,
> With a health to each jovial and true-hearted soul."

### THE STORMY WINDS DO BLOW

*(One of Charles Sloman's, 1840)*

> "One Friday morn when we set sail,
> Not very far from land,
> We there did espy a fair pretty maid
> With a comb and a glass in her hand, her hand, her hand,
> With a comb and a glass in her hand.
>
> While the raging seas did roar,
> And the stormy winds did blow,
> While we jolly sailor-boys were up unto the top,
> And the land-lubbers lying down below, below, below,
> And the land-lubbers lying down below.
>
> Then up starts the capt'n of our gallant ship,
> And a brave young man was he;
> 'I've a wife and child in fair Bristol town,
> But a widow I fear she will be.'
>
> Then up starts the mate of our gallant ship,
> And a bold young man was he;
> 'Oh, I have a wife in fair Portsmouth town,
> But a widow I fear she will be.'
>
> Then up starts the cook of our gallant ship,
> And a gruff old soul was he;
> 'Oh, I have a wife in Plymouth town,
> But a widow I fear she will be.'
>
> And then up spoke the little cabin-boy,
> And a pretty little boy was he;
> 'Oh, I am more grieved for my daddy and my mammy,
> Than you for your wives all three.'
>
> Then three times round went our gallant ship,
> And three times round went she;
> For the want of a life-boat they all went down,
> And she sank to the bottom of the sea."

---

In Mr. Christie's collection of "Traditional Ballad Airs," I found a song called "Sailing in the Lowlands, Low":

> "There was a good ship from the North countrie,
> And that ship's name was the Golden Vanitee;
> Sailing low in the Lowlands, low in the sea,
> Sailing low in the Lowlands, low."

*(The story is that of the cabin-boy boring holes in the Spanish galleon. His cruel master refuses to take him on board again.)*

> "'I will not take you up, boy,' the master he replied,
> 'Though you sink in the Lowlands, low.
> I will not take you up, boy,' his cruel master cried;
> 'I will kill you, if you come on deck, and throw you down the tide,
> I will sink you in the Lowlands, low.'
>
> His messmates took him up, but on the deck he died,
> It was in the Lowlands, low.
> Then they took the little boy, and sewed him in a hide,
> And they threw him overboard to go down with the tide,
> And he sank in the Lowlands, low."

---

### WE BE THREE POOR MARINERS

> "We be three poor mariners, we be three poor mariners,
> Newly come from the seas,
> While others live at ease.
> Shall we go dance the round, the round, the round,
> Shall we go dance the round, the round, the round.
> And he that is a bully (jolly) boy
> Come pledge me on this ground, a ground, a ground.
>
> We care not for those martial men
> That do our states disdain,
> But we care for the merchantmen
> Who do our states maintain.
> To them we dance this round, around, around,
> To them we dance this round, around, around.
> And he that is a bully boy
> Come pledge me on this ground, a ground, a ground."

---

### TO ALL YOU LADIES NOW AT LAND

*(Written at sea, by the late Earl of Dorset, in the first Dutch War.)*

> "To all you ladies now at land,
> We men at sea indite;
> But first would have you understand
> How hard it is to write;
> The Muses now, and Neptune too,
> We must implore to write to you.
> With a fa la, la, la, la."

*(There are eleven stanzas to this song, written the night before a naval engagement.)*

---

### TRUE BLUE

> "If the enemy should dare to meet us once more,
> Like lightning to our guns then we fly;
> Our great guns shall roar like thunder in the air,
> Determined to conquer or to die.
>
> None can equal the courage of True Blue,
> He dies by his gun, Britain's rights to maintain,
> None can equal the courage of True Blue."

*(This song was noted down for me by the steward of the Dreadnought Hospital for Seamen, at Greenwich, who persuaded the one remaining pensioner to sing it. The old fellow was upwards of ninety, and almost stone deaf.)*

I had some difficulty in explaining to him why I wanted him to sing me something he had known in his younger days, but when he did understand he seemed greatly interested, and assured me over and over again what a fine set of men sailors were, and how well worthy of any commemoration, for he added, "They've done something for England, and England hasn't always done much for them."

By the kind permission of Captain Algernon Drummond, composer of the music, and his co-author of the words, I am able to quote the "Eton Boat-Song":

> "Jolly boating weather,
> And a hay harvest breeze,
> Blade on the feather,
> Shade off the trees;
> Swing, swing together
> With your backs between your knees.
>
> Harrow may be more clever,
> Rugby may make more row;
> But we'll row, row for ever,
> Steady from stroke to bow.
> And nothing in life shall sever
> The chain that is round us now.
>
> Others will fill our places,
> Dressed in the old light blue;
> We'll recollect our races,
> We'll to the flag be true.
> And youth will be still in our faces,
> When we cheer for an Eton crew.
>
> Twenty years hence, this weather
> May tempt us from office stools;
> We may be slow on the feather,
> And seem to the boys old fools.
> But we'll still swing together,
> And swear by the best of schools."

---

### THE BALLAD OF JOHN DORY

*(Found in Hawkins's History of Music)*

> "As it fell on a holiday,
> And upon a holy-tide,
> John Dory bought him an ambling nag
> To Paris for to ride a.
>
> And when John Dory to Paris was come,
> A little before the gate a;
> John Dory was fitted, the porter was witted,
> To let him in thereat a.
>
> The first man that John Dory did meet,
> Was good King John of France a!
> John Dory conn'd well of his courtesie,
> But fell down in a trance a.
>
> 'A pardon, a pardon, my liege and my king;
> For my merry men and for me a;
> And all the churles in merrie England,
> I'll bring them all bound to thee a.'
>
> Sir Nichol was then a Cornish man,
> A little beside Boligde a;
> And he mann'd forth a good blacke barke,
> With fiftie good oares on a side a.
>
> Run up, my boy, unto the main-top,
> And looke what thou canst spie a;
> Who, oh! a goodly ship I do see,
> I trow it be John Dory a.
>
> The roaring canons then were plide,
> And dub a dub went the drumme a;
> The braying trumpets loudly cride,
> To 'courage both all and some a.
>
> The grappling hooks were brought at length,
> The browne bill and the sword a;
> John Dory at length, for all his strength,
> Was clapt fast under board a."

As I write these few closing remarks on the songs and chanties of English and American sailors, a somewhat curious instance of Jack's musical ideas comes before me. "A piano-organ had just commenced to fill the street with the sounds of a hornpipe when a man having the appearance of a sailor passed along, and was at once attracted by the music. He then proceeded to the spot, and commenced to dance to the music. His dancing was neat and finished, and he was soon the centre of an admiring crowd." When a waltz was played, Jack was equally at home; but when a gavotte was played his terpsichorean antics were brought to a sudden close. After giving a few more coppers to the woman, he was suited with a schottische. The climax was, however, reached when the "Marseillaise" was ground out. 'Jack' brought himself to a standstill, and after making sure of the tune, he beat a hasty retreat, amid the mingled laughter and regret of the onlookers.

In spite of the assertion that singing and steam are irreconcilable, and that the chanty-man has passed away, I yet contend that the modern sailor knows much more of music than is generally believed. Jack's whole life and soul seem to be in his legs when a hornpipe is played, whether at sea or on shore, and he is not more likely to attempt a jig to a martial air, or a waltz to the time of a gavotte, than a popular prima-donna would be to sing an aria in the wrong key.

## GAELIC BOAT SONGS AND SCOTCH SEA SONGS

In my small collection of Russian sailors' songs, I have included a specimen of the songs sung by the women when crushing the grain on the wharf, previous to loading the vessels with it. The same custom appears to have existed in the Hebrides; short, plaintive, Gaelic chants called "Luinigs" were used. The men had what were known as "Jorrams" or rowing songs, to which they kept time with their oars. These "Luinigs" and "Jorrams" differ from the Highland music in being adapted to the harp, on which a chord was doubtless struck from time to time to serve as a rudimentary accompaniment, and after the harp fell into disuse the Luinigs gradually died out.

A very characteristic sample of the style of one of these old "Jorrams," or rowing songs, is to be found in Sir Walter Scott's "Lady of the Lake." The song "Hail to the Chief," which is sung by the clansmen in honour of Roderick Vich Alpine, is an imitation of the Jorrams or boat-songs of the Highlanders:

> "Row, vassals, row, for the pride of the Highlands,
> Stretch to your oars, for the evergreen pine.
> O! that the rosebud that graces yon islands,
> Were wreathed in a garland around him to twine!
> O that some seedling gem,
> Worthy such noble stem,
> Honoured and blessed in their shadow might grow.
> Loud should Clan-Alpine then
> Ring from his deepmost glen,
> Roderigh Vich Alpine Dhu, ho! ieroe!"

---

### FEAR A BHATA (THE BOATMAN)

> 1. "How often hunting the highest hill-top,
> I scan the ocean thy sail to see;
> Wilt come tonight, love? Wilt come to-morrow?
> Wilt ever come, love, to comfort me?
> Fear a Bhata, na horo eile,
> Fear a Bhata, na horo eile,
> Fear a Bhata, na horo eile,
> O fare thee well, love, where'er thou goest."
>
> 2. "They call thee fickle, they call thee false one,
> And seek to change me, but all in vain,
> No, thou'rt my dream yet throughout the dark night,
> And every morn yet I watch the main."
>
> 3. "There's not a hamlet too well I know it
> Where you go wandering or stay awhile,
> But all its old folk you win with talking,
> And charm its maidens with song and smile.
> Dost thou remember the promise made me,
> The tartan plaidie, the silken gown,
> The ring of gold, with thy hair and portrait?
> That gown and ring I will never own."

---

### OCH NAN OCH, MO LEIR CHRADH (OH, MY PAINFUL SORROW)

This is another boatman's favourite, treating of a bold and adventurous seaman, Iain Garbh MacGille Challum of Ulathsay, who was lost on Hesgair.

> 1. "Och nan och, my painful sorrow
> At the fate of the warrior!
> The hunter of the deer
> Is not to-day in the forest of steep mountains.
> Hu-a ho, io ho, hug riu, O!"
>
> 2. "The day has been that I did not think,
> Although it is vain to repeat it,
> Thou ever couldst have been drowned
> In an open sea."
>
> 3. "While the helm should endure,
> And thou shouldst be in the command,
> Despite the fierce war of the elements
> And the angry tumult of the ocean."
>
> 4. "So long as should together remain
> The planks and the gearing,
> And she could obey
> The strong arm on the deep."

---

By kind permission I quote the following from "Songs of the North," edited by Annie Macleod and Harold Boulton. The "Skye Boat-Song" (Jacobite) illustrates an episode in the wanderings of Prince Charlie in the winter of 1745-6:

> Chorus. "Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,
> Onward, the sailors cry,
> Carry the lad that's born to be king,
> Over the sea to Skye."
>
> 1. "Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,
> Thunder-clouds rend the air;
> Baffled, our foes stand by the shore;
> Follow, they will not dare."
>
> 2. "Though the waves leap, soft shall ye sleep;
> Ocean's a royal bed;
> Rocked in the deep, Flora will keep
> Watch by your weary head."

---

### DOMHNUL RUADH GAOLACH (DONALD, RED-HAIRED AND BELOVED)

*(An expedition of loyal Highlanders on their way from the Isle of Skye to join the army of Montrose.)*

> "Donald, red-haired and beloved,
> Who standest firmly by an oak helm,
> Wild is the course of thy boat,
> Cleaving the roaring sea,
> Keep a sharp eye on the sea-rock Baru,
> Sail on the crest of the phosphoric waves."

---

### HO, RO! CLANSMEN

> "Cheerily, and all together!
> Ho, ro, Clansmen!
> A long, strong pull together!
> Ho, ro, Clansmen!
> Soon the flowing breeze will blow,
> Will blow the snowy canvas on her.
> Ho, ro, Clansmen!
> A long, strong pull together,
> Ho, ro, Clansmen!
> Wafted by the breeze of morn
> We'll quaff the joyous horn together."

---

### LOVE BOAT SONG (JORRAM)

> 4. "Row on, row on, my hearties,
> Seize an oar, and raise the boat-song;
> Bring her quick to yonder haven,
> Lest from me my bride be taken."
>
> Chorus. "Falv ora ho, Ro shin Robeg,
> Och ora ho, Ro shin Robeg,
> Falv ora ho, Ro shin Robeg,
> Lift up your song, and speed the boatie."
>
> 5. "Heave on, my boatie, dancing lightsome
> Against wind and flood and rushing tide-wave.
> Soon we'll be in Clachan-Sailich,
> Where with trembling heart she waits me."

---

In an old collection of Scotch ballads and songs ("Ancient Ballads and Songs of the North of Scotland," by Peter Buchan, 1828) I found the ballad of Sir Patrick Spens, which I am told used to be a great favourite with Scotch seamen. The first verse:

> "The king sits in Dunfermline town,
> A-drinking at the wine;
> Says, 'Where will I get a good skipper
> Will sail the saut seas fine?'"

---

Professor Blackie's lecture mentioned Lady Nairne's "Caller Herrin'" as a beautiful song:

> "When ye were sleeping on your pillows,
> Dreamt ye aught o' our puir fellows,
> Darkling as they face the billows,
> A' to fill our woven willows.
> Buy my caller herrin',
> They're bonnie fish and halesome farin'.
> Buy my caller herrin',
> New drawn frae the Forth.
> Wha'll buy my caller herrin'?
> They're no brought here without brave darin',
> Buy my caller herrin', ye little ken their worth!
> Wha'll buy my caller herrin'?
> O, ye may ca' them vulgar farin'
> Wives and mithers maist despairin',
> Ca' them lives o' men."

---

### A CRAB SONG

*(From Dunbar, to the tune of "There is nae Luck aboot the Hoose")*

> "Come, Sandy, man,
> An' bear a han',
> Rax doon anither oar,
> There's creels to bait,
> An' creels to set,
> An' crabs to bring ashore.
>
> For crabs are east,
> An' crabs are west,
> An' crabs are in the bay;
> There's fifty dizzen at the least
> In a' the creels the day.
>
> Fling in the tow,
> Steer aff her bow
> An' get the boat to sea;
> There's crabs galore
> To bring ashore,
> Just waitin' you an' me.
>
> To glunch and gloom,
> An' sook yer thoom,
> Will no buy Jenny's tea,
> Nor put a frock
> On little Jock;
> Then let us get to sea.
>
> Let ithers try
> F'or fish to fry,
> At saxteen pence a score;
> Our creels we'll get,
> Our creels we'll set,
> An' bring the crabs ashore.
>
> For crabs are meat
> An' crabs are drink
> To fisher-folk, we say,
> An' fifty dizzen at the least
> Are in the creels the day."

## KEELMEN'S AND FISHERMEN'S SONGS, AND SONGS OF THE PRESS GANG ON TYNESIDE

### WEEL MAY THE KEEL ROW

The local song of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, "The Keel Row," is intimately connected with Sandgate, the Wapping of Newcastle and the residence of the keelmen and sailors. It is truly the national anthem of the "Canny Toon."

> "As I cam thro' Sandgate, thro' Sandgate, thro' Sandgate,
> As I cam thro' Sandgate, I heard a lassie sing:
>
> Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row;
> Weel may the keel row, that my laddie's in.
>
> He wears a blue bonnet, blue bonnet, blue bonnet,
> He wears a blue bonnet, a dimple in his chin."

Another version:

> "Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row,
> Weel may the keel row,
> And better may she speed;
> Weel may the keel row, the keel row, the keel row,
> Weel may the keel row,
> That gets the bairns their breed.
>
> 1. We tuik wor keel up te the dyke,
> An' there we gat her load;
> Then sailed away doon te Shields,
> And shipped wor coals aboard.
>
> 2. Then we rowed away up te the fest
> Cheerly every man;
> Pat by wor geer and moored wor keel,
> Then went an' drank wor can.
>
> 3. Wor canny wives, wor clean fireside,
> Wor bonny bairns their parent's pride
> Sweet smiles that myek life smoothly glide,
> We find when we gan hyem."

---

### THE SANDGATE LASS'S LAMENT

> "I was a young maiden truly,
> And lived in Sandgate Street;
> I thought to marry a good man,
> To keep me warm and neat;
>
> Some good-like body, some bonny body,
> To be with me at noon;
> But last I married a keelman,
> And my good days are done.
>
> I thought to marry a parson,
> To hear me say my prayers
> But I have married a keelman,
> And he kicks me down the stairs.
>
> I thought to marry a dyer,
> To dye my apron blue;
> But I have married a keelman,
> And he makes me sairly rue.
>
> I thought to marry a joiner,
> To make me chair and stool;
> But I have married a keelman,
> And he's a perfect fool.
>
> I thought to marry a sailor,
> To bring me sugar and tea;
> But I have married a keelman,
> And that he lets me see."

---

### CAPTAIN BOVER (PRESS GANG SONG)

> "Where hes ti' been, maw canny hinny?

### LIBERTY FOR THE SAILORS

> "Lasses, call your lads ashore,
> Lasses, call your lads ashore,
> Lasses, call your lads ashore.
> There's liberty for the sailors.
>
> Liberty and money free,
> There's liberty for the sailors.
>
> Let the lubbers lie aboard,
> Let the lubbers lie aboard,
> Let the lubbers lie aboard,
> Because they're nobbut tailors.
> But, lasses, call your lads ashore."

> My bonny keel laddie for me, O!
> He sits in his keel as black as the deil,
> And he brings the white money to me, O!
>
> Hae ye seen owt o' my canny man,
> And are ye sure he's weel, O!
> He's gaen o'er land wiv a stick in his hand,
> To help to moor the keel, O!

>
> O bring me a boatman, I'll give any money,
> And you for your trouble rewarded shall be,

---

### NAE MAIR WE'LL FISH THE COOLLY TYNE

> "Nae mair we'll fish the coolly Tyne,
> Nae mair the oozy Team,
> Nae mair we'll try the sedgy Pont,
> Or Derwent's woody stream;

> Luck to the rod and line;
> Wi' morn's first beam, we'll wade the stream,
> The night we'll wet with wine."

Tyne river song (to the tune of "Auld Lang Syne"):

> "Tyne river, running rough or smooth,
> Brings bread to me and mine;
> Of all the rivers north or south,
> There's none like coaly Tyne.
> So here's to coaly Tyne, my lads,
> Success to coaly Tyne."

## CANADIAN BOAT SONGS

Almost as celebrated as the sailors' songs of England, and the gondoliers' of Venice, are the boat-songs of the old Canadian voyageurs. The hymns to their patron saint, Saint Anne, that are so popular with the Breton fishermen of to-day, all owe their origin to the French-Canadian pilgrims of the olden time. The very word "Chanty" is the name originally applied to these boat-songs of Canada, derived from the verb "chanter" (to sing).

Moore's "Boat Glee" in "M.P., or The Blue-Stocking":

> "The song that lightens the languid way
> When brows are glowing,
> And faint with rowing,
> Is like the spell of Hope's airy lay,
> To whose sound through life we stray."

The beloved Canadian boat-song by Moore, written on the River St. Lawrence:

> "Faintly as tolls the evening chime,
> Our voices keep tune and our oars keep time,
> Soon as the woods on shore look dim,
> We'll sing at St. Anne's our parting hymn.
> Row, brothers, row, the stream runs fast,
> The rapids are near, and the daylight's past!
>
> Why should we yet our sail unfurl?
> There is not a breath the blue wave to curl!
> But when the wind blows off the shore,
> Oh! sweetly we'll rest our weary oar.
> Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast,
> The rapids are near, and the daylight's past!
>
> Utawas' tide! this trembling moon
> Shall see us float over thy surges soon.
> Saint of this green isle! hear our prayers,
> Oh! grant us cool heavens and favouring airs.
> Blow, breezes, blow, the stream runs fast,
> The rapids are near, and the daylight's past!"

---

### V'LA L'BON VENT

> Chorus. "There's a good wind,
> There's a fine wind,
> There's a good wind,
> And my love is calling me.
> There's a good wind,
> There's a fine wind,
> There's a good wind,
> And my love is awaiting me.
>
> Solo. Behind our home
> There is a pond,
> Three handsome ducks
> Go there to paddle."

---

### EN REVENANT DE LA JOLI' ROCHELLE

> "In returning from pretty Rochelle,
> I met three charming demoiselles,
> There's the dear my heart loves,
> There's the dear my heart loves."

---

### A SAINT-MALO, BEAU PORT DE MER

> "At St. Malo, beautiful seaport, (repeat)
> Three big ships arrived.
> We will go on the water,
> We will go and walk,
> We will go and play on the island."

*(The song continues through a bargaining exchange between ladies and a merchant about the price of corn.)*

The French-Canadians are a light-hearted, song-loving people, and the very poorest amongst them have an instinctive taste for music; and many of the boatmen, raftsmen and voyageurs among the Iroquois Indians served under Lord Wolseley in Egypt, and might often be heard singing their quaint old-world songs.

## FRENCH SAILORS' AND BOATMEN'S SONGS

In France the system of maritime conscription has been brought to almost mechanical perfection, and 172,000 men between the ages of eighteen and fifty are inscribed on the rolls.

My province lies simply with the sailors' songs. Monsieur Paul Sebillot tells me that out of five hundred songs he has collected from the peasants and people generally of Bretagne, he has rarely come across any at all pertaining to the sea — only some five or six may lay claim to the title.

### LES MARINS DE GROIX (THE SAILORS OF GROIX)

> "We were three sailors of Groix,
> On board of the Saint François;
> Gaining forty-five francs per month,
> And wine with every repast.
> A land-breeze had just sprung up;
> We were obliged to sail to windward.
> The captain sounds his whistle,
> 'Prepare to lighten the top-sails.'
> The sailor falls into the water,
> And the long-boat is lowered,
> But they only find his hat,
> His pipe-guard, and his knife.
> Oh! pity the poor sailor."

### LA CHANSON DES MARINIERS (THE BOATMEN'S SONG)

> "My father has had a house built,
> Pull, then, with all our strength,
> Pull, ah! pull, oarsmen, pull,
> Pull all together with our oars.
>
> By eighty handsome boys,
> The King has passed in the vicinity,
> To whom, then, belongs this house?
> It belongs to my daughter Jeanneton."

### ALI! ALO!

The French chanty so popularly known as "Ali! alo!" originates with the sailors and dock-labourers of the Port of Dunkerque. Any day in Dunkerque you may hear this "Ali! alo!" trolled out by dozens of them as you pass along the quay:

> Solo. "Ali, alo,
> Chorus. Ali, ali, alo.
> Solo. He eats the meat
> And gives us the bones.
> Chorus. Ali, ali, ali, alo.
> Solo. He drinks the wine
> And gives us the water."
